The United States is now a net exporter of natural gas, but we’re still a significant net importer of crude oil. We’re still exposed to global oil prices and we know that high gasoline prices here are incredibly politically unpopular. I think that the public believes that the government has more control over oil prices than it actually does, and that can be a real problem for the incumbent administration during times of high oil prices...One of the biggest challenges is that the region is still important not just to our economic stability, but to global economic stability. But as United States has been marketed as a new global oil superpower, particularly by the current administration, the American public has lost its desire to take care of “our oil.” The world is certainly still dependent on Middle Eastern oil, and we’re still somewhat dependent on it, but we’re losing our political will to take care of that in the way we used to, and it’s not clear what will fill that gap...BRUCE JONES: Well there is another actor in this region that we tend not to think about, which is Beijing. China is now the largest consumer of oil from the Middle East, has huge stakes in the flow of oil from the region, and has begun to invest in instruments that can over time build influence in the region...But Samantha, have we reached a point where American swing production is able to compensate for some degree of instability in the global energy market? To compensate for outages in Libya or Yemen or Syria, though likely not Saudi Arabia? Is that right?..SAMANTHA GROSS: That’s right. We definitely have more ability to take up slack than we used to because of the type of oil production that’s happening here in the United States. The important thing about U.S. shale production is that it can respond to prices much more quickly than production that we had before, and you can see new production come on line in maybe six to nine months. That’s never going to outweigh Saudi..7..Foreign Policy at Brookings..the new geopolitics of the middle east: america’s role in a changing region",

By providing drips of information convincingly incriminating the Saudi government and Mohammed bin Salman in the murder, Erdoğan was able to keep the saga alive domestically but also internationally. It gave him the opportunity to display Turkey’s policing and intelligence capabilities as well as project an image of himself as a leader standing up for a slain journalist and demanding justice for him.

But it does at least dampen and reduce the duration of price shocks, though it can’t eliminate all of those effects...SUZANNE MALONEY: Still, returning to the political sensitivity of oil prices, how do you reconcile forcing Iran’s oil production off the market with maintaining low domestic oil prices? Saudi Arabia has some spare capacity but they can’t necessarily deploy it quickly to the market. It doesn’t leave a lot of flexibility in the markets for disruptions from Nigeria, Libya, or a number of other wild cards...SAMANTHA GROSS: Or collapsing Venezuelan production...SUZANNE MALONEY: Right. There is an inherent paradox in the desire to have very low oil prices for domestic political purposes and a desire to use oil or oil exports as a lever for pressuring adversarial countries. You can’t achieve both at the same time...BRUCE RIEDEL: The Iran example points to another odd thing. Since 1979, no Middle Eastern country has taken oil off the market. Only the United States has taken oil off the market. It’s been American sanctions against Iraq, Libya, and Iran, and now Iran again, that have reduced oil on the market. It isn’t the region that’s a threat to the market. If you look at the historical record of the last quarter century, it’s the United States of America that’s a threat to the market...SUZANNE MALONEY: And that’s a huge shift. Think of the concern well into and beyond the 1970s and 1980s about the willingness of Middle Eastern leaders to use oil as a weapon. It is the United States that has used oil as a weapon...SAMANTHA GROSS: Well, the first time we did the Iran sanctions, before the JCPOA was signed, one of the reasons why the United States was able to so strongly sanction, and get the world on board with the sanctions, was because of rapidly rising U.S. oil production at the time, which really dampened the price impact. Whereas now, with things going wrong in other parts of the world and demand increasing, there isn’t quite that much leeway. There seems to be this desire to have our cake and eat it too in terms of taking Iranian oil production off the market and wanting low oil prices.",

  "page_content": "After the accession of King Salman to the Saudi throne, Turkey developed close relations with Muhammad bin Nayef and managed to sustain a collaborative relationship against all odds. However, once Mohammed bin Salman successfully maneuvered himself into the position of crown prince in July 2017, the picture began to change dramatically and the Saudi-Turkish relationship became increasingly strained. This coincided with an escalating crisis between the two sides when Saudi Arabia together with Bahrain, the UAE, and Egypt severed all ties with Qatar and imposed an economic blockade over Qatar’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood and its refusal to terminate its ties with Iran. In response, Turkey sent additional troops to its small military base in Qatar as a deterrent against a possible Saudi military intervention, which would seek the overthrown of Tamim al Thani, the emir of Qatar. Turkey further deepened its ties with Qatar establishing a new food logistic line via Iran, enabling it to withstand the blockade. Yet, what aggravated matters for Erdoğan most were Mohammed bin Salman’s policies toward Israel, his willingness to entertain Trump’s Middle East peace plan with Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, his close relationship with Jared Kushner, and his decision to pledge $100 million to help with reconstruction in northeastern parts of Syria controlled by U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds...The murder of Khashoggi thus became a golden opportunity for Erdoğan to embark on an ambitious project and seek a change in the line of succession to the Saudi throne by discrediting the legitimacy of the crown prince. The whole Khashoggi affair has benefitted Erdoğan domestically as well as internationally, even though it is not evident that he succeeded in achieving his ambition to see Mohammed bin Salman removed from power. Yet, throughout the saga, Erdoğan kept King Salman out of the scandal and showed deference by referring to him as the custodian of the holy mosques. This suggests that for the time being Erdoğan is likely to continue to seek a pragmatic relationship with Saudi Arabia, especially at a time when Turkey is going through economic difficulties and needs Saudi finance and trade. However, the presence of Mohammed bin Salman at the helm of Saudi foreign policy will ensure that both sides remain locked in a major rivalry as far as the future of Middle East geopolitics is concerned...final word",

Yet while it’s easy to focus on Trump’s unwillingness to rein in the Saudis in Yemen, this war began during the Obama administration. It was the Obama administration that directly engaged and expanded the U.S. role in the war. Fundamentally, it’s a function of this difficult relationship between Washington and Riyadh, and our unwillingness and/or inability to impose constraints on a partner and an important ally, which happens to be a country with deep domestic and regional issues that we should not implicate ourselves in...TAMARA COfMAN WITTES: It is worth contemplating that when the Obama administration came in and focused on stabilizing Iraq and peacemaking between Israelis and Palestinians, it was operating to an extent on old premises about the Middle East, that stabilizing Iraq and working Arab-Israeli peace was enough to keep the region in a good place and let the United States pivot to Asia...That premise was based on false assumptions about the roots of instability in the region, and we saw that erupt in 2011 with the Arab uprisings. The real roots of instability in the region were coming from the bottom up, from demographic challenges, failed governance, failed economic programs, and the forces of globalization impacting the region, the information environment, and the economy in ways that these states couldn’t control. That was a set of assumptions that never worked their way into the early Obama policy for the Middle East. They sort of landed on the doorstep of the Obama administration, and I think forced a recalculation...26..Foreign Policy at Brookings..the new geopolitics of the middle east: america’s role in a changing region..And so the challenge that Obama faced in his second term, that I think Trump faces and future American presidents will face, is not how do we back away from the Middle East, but can we back away from the Middle East. And if we can’t do so without destabilizing it further, what are we willing to invest in stabilizing it.",

I want to think about each country’s core strategic objectives in the region. Suzanne, what are Iran’s core strategic objectives in the Middle East?..SUZANNE MALONEY: Fundamentally, Iran is driven by a desire to ensure the longevity of the regime, which is hardly surprising. Since the 1979 revolution, the Iranians have felt isolated in their region and in the world. They perceive themselves to be an embattled revolutionary state, a government that the United States and other world powers would like to eradicate if possible. And so they seek to extend their influence wherever possible...There is an ideological dimension to it; in both the Iranian Constitution and the mindset of the leadership, the invocation to export the revolution has always been a priority. The Islamic revolution for Iranians was never intended to be a revolution in one country, it was intended and conceived of as something that would radiate throughout the Islamic world and beyond because of the anti-imperialist world view of the revolutionary leadership.",

I don’t think that Russia goes out of its way to produce instability vis-à-vis the impact on oil prices, but instability that drives oil prices up is not something they have to worry about...And then there’s the kind of strange Erdoğan-Putin dynamic, which has been very tense at times, then an effort at rapprochement. I don’t know exactly what we’d say about where we are right now...President Vladimir Putin of Russia, Hassan Rouhani of Iran and Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey attend a news conference following their meeting in Tehran, Iran September 7, 2018. Kirill Kudryavtsev/Pool via REUTERS..AMANDA SLOAT: Turkey and Russia have a complicated relationship. Nowhere is this illustrated more clearly than in Syria, where they are on different sides of the conflict with Putin backing the Assad regime and Erdoğan supporting the opposition. Their relations hit a low point in November 2015 when Turkey downed a Russian fighter jet for violating its airspace. Erdoğan remarkably apologized to Putin seven months later, after suffering from painful economic sanctions and more importantly given Ankara’s need for Moscow’s acquiescence to a Turkish military operation to prevent the Syrian Kurds from creating a contiguous region alongside its border. A major crisis was averted recently in Idlib, as Turkey and Russia agreed to enforce a new demilitarized zone, but tensions could easily flare up again...MARTIN INDYK: In contrast with the United States’ withdrawal, Putin is engaged in a very deliberate effort to fill any resulting gaps, starting with Syria, even if it was never of great strategic importance to the United States. The Russians were able to use a military presence there to gain outsized influence across the region precisely because of its military engagement at a time when the United States is withdrawing militarily. At least that’s the perception.",

This entire conceptualization of how the United States would assert power in the Middle East has always been, if not entirely reliant, at least primarily contingent upon local regional states that were close partners, in most cases not allies, through which we exerted influence and were always to some extent distorted through that relationship. What is different—or perhaps what’s notable—is that it’s not just the Iranians that use proxies, it’s also the United States. We’re spending a billion dollars a year in Syria. This idea that we weren’t present in Syria is simply untrue. We may not have been able to produce the outcome we wanted, but the idea that we were a completely missing actor in the evolution of that conflict is one of the most dangerous myths about the Obama administration’s approach to that conflict...It’s also important to appreciate how all of these actors, including Iran, are shaping their responses based on an American state that has been, through several administrations, erratic, unpredictable, and in many ways destructive. We’re always talking about Iran’s destabilizing activities. The reality is that the greatest destabilization in the Middle East in the past 20 years has been the United States’ decision to invade Iraq and its subsequent failure to appreciate how regional actors would respond. It’s not an absolution for how Iranians have sought to assert themselves through violence and groups that are prone to trying to destroy rather than to build. But fundamentally, if you remove that episode, then I think you have a very different set of dynamics in the region today. We seem unwilling to recognize that our role in these ongoing conflicts is enormous.",

If we think of the proxy wars, a lot of what is happening is being perpetrated by groups that are outside the influence of any one actor. And that’s a big part of the problem and a big part of the calculation of all the other actors: how do we deal with these ungoverned groups, with al-Qaida types, ISIS affiliates, or anyone else. The Arab Spring led to the disintegration of a lot of state capacity. Those governments that remain are the ones that are now playing on this field. But the disintegration of Iraq, Syria, and Libya, that’s where you get this abyss. And that’s a crucial element. It’s not quite proxy wars, it’s really wars against this morass. And it very much affects the way the Russians, Egyptians, Israelis, nearly everyone, think of things...BRUCE JONES: We’ve gone away from a phase in geopolitics where the major powers saw, at least in the main, a common interest in working together to tamp down civil wars. Great power cooperation on managing conflicts resulted in a huge decline in the levels of wars in the world over the last 20 years. More recently,..22..Foreign Policy at Brookings..the new geopolitics of the middle east: america’s role in a changing region..we’ve seen the fusion of civil wars and terrorism. More than 90 percent of all battle deaths in civil wars in the last five years have been in places where a terrorist group is one of the principal actors in the fight. People say, “Oh, all the powers share an interest in squashing terrorism,” but it’s not the reality. Instead of cooperating, interested actors get involved via proxies, which fuels and actually amplifies the dynamics of violence. We’ve seen a continuous increase in the scale of violence in these contexts where terrorism and civil war fuse, and we’re paralyzed into a dynamic of amplifying the proxy warfare rather than resolving it.",

And if there are troubling aspects about Donald Trump’s behavior in the Middle East, to Saudis and other Arabs, Mike Pence is a nightmare come true because he’ll do anything to fulfill what evangelical Americans want Israel to be.

And if they were more sophisticated they’d also be thinking, “What have we done to our relationship with the Democrats?” It may be very, very hard to rebuild if you get a Democratic president in the future...SUZANNE MALONEY: Is there a recognition among the Saudis that irrespective of Mueller or who controls the White House, there’s no appetite among the American people for an expanded military footprint or human commitment to the Middle East?..BRUCE RIEDEL: The Saudis aren’t looking for the United States to counter Iran on each of the battlefields, they’re looking for the United States to depose the regime in Tehran, not by trying to fight it in Hodeidah and Idlib, where you’re playing into Iran’s advantage. That may be delusional, but I think that’s what their hope is...MARTIN INDYK: Just like we did in Iraq...BRUCE JONES: But does that necessarily, in their mind, involve American military action or are they sympathetic to what appears to be a pretty strong effort by this administration to use a variety of economic tools to achieve something like that result?..19..Foreign Policy at Brookings..the new geopolitics of the middle east: america’s role in a changing region",

And as Bruce Riedel has written,1 it has been involved in military adventures and misadventures for a lot longer than that. But I think there’s no real doubt that there have been two qualitative shifts in the past couple of years...One is the wider breakdown of regional order and dramatic intensification of violence in the region since the Arab Spring took a wrong turn, so to speak.2 If you look at the 2000s, about 8 percent of all global battle deaths occurred in the Middle East. In the last five years, it’s grown to 70 percent. To put it in starker terms, if you include Afghanistan and a wider arc of instability, 95 percent of all global battle deaths over the past five years have been in majority-Muslim countries. You hear talk about a global upturn in violence and conflict—that’s not true. Conflict is on the decline in every region of the world except for the Middle East and North Africa...The second major trend, which is harder to quantify, is the qualitative shift in the perception of America’s role and presence—a broad perception of America pulling back or not carrying the weight it once did. Whether it’s empirically true or not, there’s clearly a broad perception of that...Those strike me as the two key developments, but against a backdrop of huge economic growth in countries like Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Russia in the 2000s, and economic doldrums in Egypt long before the Arab Spring, made worse by it. We thus have a very different texture to the geopolitics of the region, and that’s where I want to start...Natan, how would you frame the geopolitics of the Middle East today?",

  "page_content": "10..Foreign Policy at Brookings..the new geopolitics of the middle east: america’s role in a changing region..Which gets me to my last point. Saudi Arabia may have more aspirations for regional leadership today than it has ever had. Witness that they just signed a peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea in Saudi Arabia, and brought in Djibouti as well. The prime minister of Pakistan made his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, and President Trump made his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. Yet while the Saudis are definitely very active diplomatically, questions about the stability of the Kingdom are higher now that they’ve been in 50 years. And there is a very serious question about what the line of succession is going to produce, and whether it will be disrupted by some kind of internal political upheaval. It is very fascinating that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has spent the last four months sleeping every night on a yacht off Jeddah in the Red Sea because he doesn’t feel safe sleeping on the ground...JEffREY fELTMAN: When the crown prince is floating on his yacht in the Red Sea, he must also be thinking about the economic and financial future of Saudi Arabia, not just counter-revolution in the region. Unlike the United Arabia Emirates or Qatar or even Kuwait, Saudi Arabia lacks the long-term comfort level of having used its energy resources to build up sizable financial reserves. So he must also be looking at the economic situation, which would explain the Ritz Carlton shakedown with some of the businesses...BRUCE JONES: Let’s turn to Turkey. It seems to me that a central and surely driving concern of Turkish engagement in the Middle East is its internal politics, including the role of President Erdoğan and a repositioning of Turkish domestic politics toward Islam. Kemal and Amanda, what are Turkey’s strategic objectives in the Middle East?..KEMAL KIRIŞCI: First of all, it’s Erdoğan’s strategy, not Turkey’s. The easiest way to capture his strategic perspective is reflected by two different hand gestures he frequently employs. From about 2012 to about nine or ten months ago, Erdogan’s strategic perspective on the Middle East was symbolized by the four-finger Rabia salute, denoting solidarity with the Muslim Brotherhood. From this you can deduce the poor relations with Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia, the close relations with Qatar, and Turkey’s ambiguous, confusing policies over Libya.",

They don’t like American extraterritorial sanctions to begin with. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas even went so far as musing about developing an alternative banking system to SWIFT, given the effect that U.S. sanctions have on this international payment mechanism. Yet Europeans implemented their own sanctions on Iran during the Obama administration, with this pressure campaign leading Iran to the negotiating table and resulting in a deal that—as Suzanne just said—Tehran is still implementing. There is no appetite in Europe to start this process over again. Europeans also felt like they made a good faith effort to engage with senior administration officials—as well as Trump himself—to address his concerns about the deal and Iran’s regional activities, but to no avail...BRUCE JONES: So in sum, we have a less influential United States; a weaker trans-Atlantic alliance; a divided GCC; activism by Turkey and Israel, no longer aligned with each other and sometimes misaligned with the United States; and above all, rising tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Together, it’s hardly a recipe for stability in the region!..closing notes..BRUCE RIEDEL: The premeditated murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018 has reshuffled the politics of the region. The Saudi crown prince is on the defensive and Turkish President Erdoğan is driving a campaign to weaken Mohammed bin Salman if not remove him from the line of succession. The Trump administration has thrown itself behind the crown prince while the American public, media, and Congress want the prince sanctioned and the war in Yemen halted...Khashoggi was an opinion writer for the Washington Post living in exile in Virginia. He was a longtime aide to Prince Turki al Faisal, and was at the consulate to get some paperwork for his marriage. Inside the consulate a team of assassins were waiting. His body has not been found...The Saudis reacted with a series of weak and crude cover stories. The Trump administration has not challenged the Saudi versions and has specifically exonerated Mohammed bin Salman. The implications of the affair are still playing out...In broad terms, the affair reinforces the importance of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and indirectly Iran in regional dynamics (Israel is a bit player on this). Turkey and Iran have gained influence at the Saudis’ expense.",

The Iranian influence in Yemen is greater now than it was before the war. Qatar’s relationship with Turkey is stronger than it was before the boycott. So I think that the Saudi decisionmaking is often producing the results that were least intended...BRUCE RIEDEL: Of all the proxy wars, the real prize is Iraq. That’s where the oil is, that’s where the natural gas is, that’s where there’s a population that’s large enough to be significant. As I said earlier, Iraq will come back at some point. Will it come back as an Iranian puppet? Probably not. Will it come back as an Iranian ally? There’s probably a good chance of that. The Iranians benefited enormously from our decision to go into Iraq, and their proxies there are getting stronger and stronger. There is resentment against Iranians, seen clearly in Basra recently, but I think the overall tilt is toward Iran. The Iranians have to play this very carefully, not overplay their hand. They’re pretty skilled at this game though. They’ve learned over the years how to play it very well...Despite all the disastrous decisions in Yemen, Qatar, Libya, and other places, the place where Saudi Arabia was said to be playing a smart role is in Iraq. I wonder if that has now backfired. Part of the reason we see the Iranians and Iranian protégés in Iraq playing tougher ball is because the minute they began to see that the Saudis wanted to play, they said, “Okay, we can’t let that happen, we’re going to whack them back down.” That’s the proxy war that I think we really should keep our eyes on the most...MARTIN INDYK: I don’t know whether you referred to the United States in the context of proxy wars, but the United States is essentially using Saudi Arabia, Israel, and to a lesser extent Egypt, as proxies for American influence in the region. This demonstrates that the absence of U.S. diplomatic initiative in all of these areas results in our dependence on these local actors, and we’re unable to achieve the objectives that we share with them...21..Foreign Policy at Brookings..the new geopolitics of the middle east: america’s role in a changing region",

Unlike in Soviet times, Russian policy is pragmatic and non-ideological, which gives it considerable flexibility. Russia has ties with all the major regional players, irrespective of their internal politics. Indeed, Russia is the only major power that talks to the Shiite states, the Sunni states, and to Israel. It has been able to establish cooperative ties with the region’s main protagonists and antagonists: Israel and the Palestinians; Israel and Iran; Iran and Saudi Arabia; Turkey and the Kurds; both Libyan governments; and Hamas and Hezbollah. Putin has taken advantage of the U.S. ambivalence about its future role in the region to re-assert Russia’s influence there. Indeed, Russia has begun to replace the United States as the go-to player in this fractured region. Its intervention in Syria and support for Assad have enabled Putin to achieve one of his major goals—Russia’s return to the global board of directors. Russia is in the Middle East for the long haul. It is seeking to convert its decisive role in Syria—ensuring that Assad prevailed and stayed in power—to a broader role of regional power broker. But there is also a domestic element here. Russia has an ongoing problem with radicalization and jihadism amongst its Muslim population—20 million and growing. The Kremlin viewed the Arab Spring, particularly what happened in Libya, as a dangerous precedent for what could happen elsewhere—including in Russia. Putin has given the figure of 4,000 people who have gone from Russia to fight with ISIS. Russia wants to ensure that these jihadists do not return home and it seeks to minimize the ability of foreign terrorist groups to radicalize Russian citizens.",

  "page_content": "BRUCE RIEDEL: I think there are four principal Saudi objectives...The first is to counter Iran. The Saudis see Iran as their principal threat in the region, and they rapidly go from countering Iran to countering Shi’ism. This is rooted deeply in Wahhabi ideology. There’s virtually no difference in their minds between the two...The second is counter-revolution, and by that I mean countering moves toward democratic political reforms in the region, which Saudi Arabia is adamantly against. Saudi Arabia makes no secret it is an absolute monarchy and has no intention of ever becoming a democratic state...The third is counterterrorism. Here there’s a paradox of course. Saudi Arabia is determined to fight terrorist groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State, which target Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia is also, because of its Wahhabi ideology, often the petri dish in which radical Islamic ideas flourish, particularly in the Muslim communities in Europe...The fourth is to counter Israel. Although here I think there are more signs of confusion within the Kingdom than we’ve seen heretofore...I make two overall comments about this. From the Saudi standpoint, many of these issues overlap. A good example is the intervention in Bahrain in 2011, which was undertaken to counter Iran, counter democratic reforms, counter Shi’ism, and, since anyone who is espousing all of those things must be a terrorist, to counter terrorism as well. They only lacked an Israeli angle. And I’m sure if they tried, they could have found one...The other thing I would say is that when you look at issue number one—countering Iran—the sorry story for the Saudis is that they’re losing, and losing badly. Lebanon and Syria were essentially lost to the Iranians in the 1980s, and the Syrian civil war has just moved them even further out of the Saudi orbit. Iraq was lost by the disastrous decision of the George W. Bush administration to intervene and then to foolishly hold elections, which guaranteed a Shiite takeover, at least from the Saudi standpoint. Yemen is a more complicated story, but the bottom line there is that the Saudis have gotten themselves into a quagmire that costs them billions of dollars a month, and costs the Iranians, at most, a couple of million dollars a month. If anyone was to look at this as a corporate entity, they would say this is a disastrous decision for you to make...10..Foreign Policy at Brookings",

The deal kicked the can down the road, but fundamentally meant that we didn’t have to be concerned about Iranians crossing the nuclear weapons threshold for at least a decade, and probably longer. But that was insufficient to all of our regional allies, and it was insufficient to at least half the American body politic. That isn’t something that we can go to the Middle East to solve, but it really does entail a much more realistic debate about what we can feasibly achieve in the region and what it means in terms of our relationships with core allies, including Israel...MARTIN INDYK: I think the Iran nuclear deal would have been acceptable to our regional allies, including Israel, if we had used it to then take care of the other problematic challenges that Iran was causing in the region. And that required us to work with our partners and allies...SUZANNE MALONEY: If that were the case, the Israeli government wouldn’t have launched such an effort against the deal, which colored the interpretation in the United States. The Saudis were effectively bystanders to the diplomacy with Iran for a decade without being heavily invested in the outcome. Part of the reason that this became such a toxic issue for all of our allies was the sense that there was regional and domestic opposition that was super empowered. And it brought Trump along with it...MARTIN INDYK: But Trump gave them the opening.

They believed that if you bring Iran more into the world, Iran would therefore find more incentives to moderate. But it’s precisely the opposite. The Iranians have been able to do business with the entire world unimpeded, except for U.S. economic pressure, for the past 40 years without changing any elements of the way they approached the region or the way they approached their own population...29..Foreign Policy at Brookings..the new geopolitics of the middle east: america’s role in a changing region..And so there was never any likelihood that rehabilitation economically and the removal of the European and multilateral sanctions and some American sanctions were going to somehow create pressures within Iran, which would then cause them to sort of back out of Syria or change their approach to Yemen or any other conflict...BRUCE JONES: Interestingly, we haven’t really discussed our European allies in the context of the Middle East today. I’d like to add a point here. I was in Berlin recently and was struck by the degree of anger among the Berlin elite at the extent of public American political pressure on German companies not to do business in Iran. And this leads to an erosion in Berlin-Washington relations that has consequences...SUZANNE MALONEY: Germany historically was Iran’s largest trade partner in the world. It was overtaken by China recently, but Iran still has major diplomatic and economic stakes in Europe.",

  "page_content": "SUZANNE MALONEY: I agree with the critique...It’s an important to remember that the deal became a theological issue here in Washington. If you were pro- Obama, you were pro-nuclear deal—you believed it was inviolable and criticism of it was inconceivable. And you had the same dynamics on the other side of the domestic debate. Unfortunately, that created the sense that preserving the deal was the entirety of U.S. policy toward Iran during the Obama administration, and that we had to go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that we preserved the deal because certainly in the minds of some Obama officials, it was the vehicle through which a broader set of agreements could be made with Iran...That’s never how the Iranians genuinely thought about it, and it was never realistic. But the efforts that the administration went to in order to reinforce Iran’s commitment to staying in the deal, we now see that was totally unnecessary. Since Trump withdrew, they’re getting no incentives, and they’re sticking by their commitments. So the roadshow that the Treasury put on, John Kerry’s efforts to try to talk up business in Iran after the implementation of the deal, were totally unnecessary. And meanwhile those efforts contributed to the sense of betrayal among our allies—that it wasn’t just a transaction, that it was in fact an American effort to make peace wholeheartedly with Iran...MARTIN INDYK: If Hillary Clinton had won the election, the policy would have been much stronger than Obama against Iran’s efforts to destabilize the region. The Clinton team had in mind to renegotiate the deal eventually as well. In those circumstances, Netanyahu would have adjusted to the new administration’s approach, but I don’t believe that he would have gone hell for leather to destroy the deal...SUZANNE MALONEY: No, and the Iranians would have walked away from it under those circumstances...MARTIN INDYK: A far better thing to happen...JEffREY fELTMAN: There was never a consistent narrative on the Iran nuclear deal. On the one hand you’d hear the administration saying this is just about one of the issues, this is just about the nuclear program. The other narrative was this is the start of something much bigger. That second narrative simply was never going to be realistic, that this was going to open the door to some great Washington-Tehran understanding about the regime and everything else. It was that second narrative that really scared our Gulf allies.",

  "page_content": "TAMARA COfMAN WITTES: Let me start by pivoting off a point that I think Bruce and Natan were both getting at in a way: in different ways, Saudi Arabia and Israel can act with a lot of capacity in the region, but it’s capacity that’s limited to certain dimensions. Israel has a lot of military and intelligence capability, but its diplomatic engagement with the rest of the region is constrained. Saudi Arabia has a lot of soft power, it’s got a lot of money, it’s got a lot of convening power, but it doesn’t have military power...And in different ways each of those capitals has traditionally relied on the United States to backstop its constrained capacity in those other dimensions. And one of the challenges for the region right now, and for those two actors, is that they’re not sure whether they can rely on Washington to backstop them in that traditional way...BRUCE JONES: Natan, while rapprochement is too strong of a term, we’ve observed significant easing of the rhetoric between Israel and Saudi Arabia. How does this look from Israel? Is there a sense of Saudi Arabia as a potential partner, or is it just opportunistic cooperation with a diminished threat?..NATAN SACHS: It’s mostly opportunistic, but the change is pretty dramatic. It’s not just rhetoric, you can see it in internal communications and curricula in Saudi Arabia, which for Israel is a very real and important thing, and even closer relations with the Emiratis. Still, I don’t think anyone has any grand illusions about a great love affair. Israel is sort of the mistress of the Middle East where everyone wants to be with it but no one wants to admit it, at least thus far. This could change, though, as so much has recently...But I think for Netanyahu and for others, there’s a very strong sense that this is a product of Israeli strength. Netanyahu recently changed course and has spoken of strategic long-term growth in military expenditure by Israel, even as a percentage of GDP. This is a dramatic change for Netanyahu, ideologically, from an economic standpoint—he’s the real economic neo-liberal and fiscal hawk of Israel. And part of the rationale is that military strength is key to why they have gained diplomatically with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and even as far afield as India.",

Europe was flooded with refugees, which apart from the devastating humanitarian situation has contributed to heightened populist sentiments there and the corresponding rise of far-right political parties...MARTIN INDYK: And the United States has viable diplomatic options. U.S. diplomatic leadership can play a positive role in the conflicts between Israel and Iran in Syria, and between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. In Syria, Israel has no choice but to deal with Moscow because we are absent from the game. And, as Kemal pointed out, Turkey, Iran, and Russia are trying to influence the political and diplomatic outcome there, and we’re not playing. Israel will quickly come to realize the limits to its ambitions in Syria because of the absence of the United States...In Yemen, the Saudis need an active American effort to get them the hell out of there. It’s the only way it’s going to work. And yet we’re not willing to do anything but supply weaponry...BRUCE RIEDEL: I want to underscore this point. If you think about smart American politics in this region, helping the Saudis get out of the morass that they’ve created in Yemen is probably the biggest thing we could do in the near term to help stabilize the Kingdom and stabilize the Arabian Peninsula. And it’s doable. We have the means.

Today, a combination of the upheavals, revolutions, and civil wars in the region, U.S. war fatigue, the shale energy revolution, and the return of great power competition have dramatically transformed the geopolitics of the Middle East. In September 2018, Bruce Jones, director of the Brookings Foreign Policy Program, convened 10 Brookings experts—Jeffrey Feltman, Samantha Gross, Martin Indyk, Kemal Kirişci, Suzanne Maloney, Bruce Riedel, Natan Sachs, Amanda Sloat, Angela Stent, and Tamara Cofman Wittes—to discuss new geopolitical alignments in the Middle East and the future of U.S. policy in the region. The edited transcript below reflects their assessments of the landscape of the new geopolitics of the Middle East; the reality and perception of U.S. withdrawal from the region; the strategic interests and goals of major regional actors; the interactions between these regional actors, including in proxy wars; and policy recommendations for U.S. strategy going forward...director’s summary..The perception of U.S. withdrawal from the Middle East overstates reality, but American influence in the region is certainly on the decline. The United States retains a significant troop presence in the region, but the American public has limited support for military engagement in Middle Eastern conflicts. The perception that the United States is no longer dependent on the region’s oil supplies is not borne out by the realities of the global oil market, but does shape contemporary American decisionmaking. The United States has stepped back from diplomatic leadership on the Middle East peace process and conflict management across the region. Only on issues related to Iran has the United States had a sustained—but not consistent—focus.",

Nearly 49 per cent of the suspects were drug users, and the rest were drug traffickers, manufacturers and transporters, the report added. “A total of 2.62 tonne of illicit drugs, 43.5 kg of dry marijuana, and 23,816 marijuana plants were seized in the suspects' possession during the January-August period of 2023,” the report said. The authorities had also impounded 30 homemade rifles, 25 pistols, 105 cars, 1,142 motorbikes, 3,518 telephones and 257 scales, as well as some cash and properties, the report added. Most of the seized drugs were ketamine, heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, methamphetamine pills, and cathinone, Xinhua news agency reported. The Southeast Asian country has no death sentence for drug traffickers. Under its law, someone found guilty of trafficking more than 80 gram of illicit drugs could be jailed for life.

In August, authorities seized an additional 871 kilograms of ketamine throughout the country...According to the NACD, authorities in Cambodia arrested more than 30,000 suspects in 10,461 drug-related cases in 2020 and 6,308 cases in 2021...Meas Vyrith told RFA that the amount of drugs seized by authorities in Cambodia so far in 2022 had increased by more than half of the total seized in all of 2021.",

  "page_content": "The latest bust also follows an announcement by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in August which said that ketamine seizures had increased sharply in Cambodia from 112.5 kilograms in 2020 to 2.8 tons in 2021 – accounting for more than 50% of all ketamine seized in Southeast Asia (5.4 tons) that year...UNODC said that the increase was associated with growing evidence of illicit manufacture of the drug in Cambodia, based on the detection of several clandestine ketamine laboratories in the country...Speaking to RFA on Monday, civil society groups urged the government to take stronger action against traffickers of ketamine and other illicit drugs to prevent Cambodia from becoming a haven for the drug trade in Southeast Asia...Cheap Sotheary, the coordinator for human rights group ADHOC in Sihanouk province, said that the authorities need to be more transparent and forthcoming about information related to drug seizures. She said that drug trafficking remains a problem in Cambodia due to corruption...“We are requesting that the information and photos of criminals be made public because we worry that local authorities may be complicit and allow them to get away,” she said...“We also have no information about the places where [authorities] keep the seized illicit drugs. We’re talking about hundreds of tons of these drugs. What would happen if the people who look after the confiscated drugs steal them and sell them themselves? It’s very dangerous without proper oversight.”..Other groups have said that the rise of drug trafficking in Cambodia shows that criminals are not afraid to set up manufacturing operations in the country...Ketamine is widely used in human and veterinary medicine and, while the drug is not under international control, its non-medical use has been related to a number of severe adverse health effects...According to UNODC, high doses of ketamine used recreationally can cause cardiovascular and respiratory toxicity effects, as well as other adverse effects like bladder problems, anxiety, panic attacks, palpitations, tachycardia, chest pains, depression, aggravated symptoms of existing mental health issues, slurred speech and inability to speak...Translated by Sok Ry Sum...MORE..Cambodia..Cambodian authorities bust Chinese drug traffickers in Phnom Penh and 3 provinces..In London, Cambodian Elites Tread in the Kremlin's Footsteps..Media Group, NGO to Investigate Defamation Case in Southwest Cambodia..Life For Anti-Drug Officials",

Despite the lack of significant efforts, the government took some steps to address trafficking, including continuing to arrest, prosecute, and convict traffickers, proactively screening for and identifying victims, and assisting in the repatriation of Cambodian trafficking victims and those vulnerable to trafficking abroad. However, endemic corruption continued to impede overall law enforcement operations, holding traffickers accountable, and victim service provision. Authorities did not investigate or hold criminally accountable any officials involved in the large majority of credible reports of complicity, in particular with unscrupulous business owners who subjected thousands of men, women, and children throughout the country to human trafficking in entertainment establishments, brick kilns, and online scam operations. Therefore, officials also failed to proactively identify trafficking victims among these highly vulnerable populations. The government did not provide adequate protection services for victims domestically or overseas and relied heavily on foreign donors and NGOs to provide much-needed care...PRIORITIZED RECOMMENDATIONS:..Investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses and convict, while respecting due process, and adequately penalize sex and labor traffickers, including complicit officials, with significant prison sentences...Increase funding to anti-trafficking law enforcement units and disburse it in advance of investigations, rather than by reimbursement...Fully implement victim identification guidelines and train officials in all areas of the country on its provisions...Allocate increased resources to anti-human trafficking police to better facilitate the monitoring of defendants released under judicial supervision pending trial.",

  "page_content": "The government maintained prevention efforts. The National Committee for Counter Trafficking (NCCT) and its secretariat coordinated anti-trafficking activities, continued to implement a 2019-2023 national anti-trafficking action plan, and initiated a mid-year review of the action plan to evaluate its achievements and remaining challenges. The NCCT produced an annual report documenting the government’s holistic anti-trafficking efforts. The NCCT chaired 274 meetings in 2021 with various ministries to elevate the importance of human trafficking within the government; it did not report how many meetings it conducted in the previous reporting period. The NCCT regularly invited trafficking survivors to attend meetings and workshops in order to improve policies through survivors’ experiences and recommendations. The secretariat of the NCCT maintained six working groups to monitor the efforts of the interagency committee, as well as those of its provincial subcommittees. Subsidiary provincial committees to counter trafficking (PCCT), four of which continued to receive modest central government funds, coordinated efforts at the local level to mirror the activities of the NAP. Each PCCT maintained customized provincial-level action plans outlining how to report cases of trafficking to police, victim protection efforts, and prevention activities. The NCCT and various PCCTs—in cooperation with relevant ministries and NGO partners—conducted 156 anti-trafficking trainings for 5,720 government officials in 2021. A Monitoring Working Group (MWG) strengthened the work of the NCCT at the provincial level by meeting with provincial officials and assessing areas of improvement, but it did not report how many times the MWG traveled to the provinces or how many officials it engaged. The Minister of Women’s Affairs and the NCCT Vice Chair co-hosted a bilateral meeting on human trafficking with a foreign government in October 2021, which was attended by senior Cambodian government officials. The government provided anti-trafficking training to Cambodian diplomatic personnel as a part of their orientation prior to deploying abroad. The NCCT provided anti-trafficking training to two units of Cambodian peacekeepers before their deployment to Lebanon and the Central African Republic. The government did not report its anti-trafficking budget in 2021, unlike in 2020 when it reported a budget of approximately 2.2 billion riels ($543,080). NGOs reported the government’s weak funding for anti-trafficking activities led some NGOs to cover the expenses of government activities.",

  "page_content": "The pandemic continued to hinder government efforts to prosecute perpetrators and heighten awareness of trafficking among officials. Cambodian courts shut down between April and May 2021, temporarily halting judicial activity including anti-trafficking investigations, and then resumed operations at a reduced capacity for several months afterwards. The government reported it cooperated with the governments of the United States, Thailand, and the PRC on human trafficking investigations; it also maintained memoranda of understanding (MOUs) outlining cross-border anti-trafficking investigations with Thailand and Vietnam, as well as an extradition treaty with the former. The government continued to cooperate with the United States through a law enforcement task force dedicated to combating online child sexual exploitation and other child sex crimes. In 2021, the police arrested four individuals for online child sexual exploitation under the anti-trafficking law after U.S. law enforcement referred nine potential cases...Nationwide, law enforcement authorities often did not take appropriate action against suspected or convicted traffickers. Judicial police lacked the resources to monitor defendants released on “judicial supervision” pending trial, allowing some to flee prior to their trial dates, which only left courts the option to convict offenders in absentia. Authorities rarely issued arrest warrants for absconded defendants unless NGOs were available to assist in tracking and apprehending them. Further compounding this challenge, Cambodian criminal procedural code featured no guidelines, monitoring provisions, or language outlining specific law enforcement duties with regard to judicial supervision. Citing resource constraints, prosecutors and investigating judges did not advance all of the trafficking cases for which police had supplied evidence. Local experts continued to report that cases involving foreign suspects were more likely to result in trafficking convictions than cases involving Cambodian suspects, for whom charges were often reduced to less serious offenses. NGOs reported law enforcement did not adequately respond to reports of trafficking allegations in remote or less developed areas of the country due to capacity limitations.",

  "page_content": "The government did not maintain a centralized record or database of investigations and judicial proceedings, therefore overall law enforcement data was incomplete, precluding the ability to compare investigations, prosecutions, and convictions from previous years. Unlike in the previous reporting period, the police did not report comprehensive data on anti-trafficking investigations conducted in 2021. According to some media reports, authorities arrested 370 suspected traffickers, which included 332 labor brokers, but the government did not report an update on these arrests. In 2021, Ministry of Justice (MOJ) personnel manually collected prosecution and conviction data from each district court throughout the country. Nevertheless, as in the prior reporting period, judicial authorities may have included cases of rape and other crimes outside the standard definition of trafficking in their reported data; therefore, the true number of trafficking prosecutions and convictions was likely lower than reported. In 2021, the government prosecuted 109 suspected traffickers involved in 64 cases under the anti-trafficking law; four of these cases involved sex trafficking, 37 involved forced labor, and 23 involved unspecified forms of exploitation. The government convicted 38 traffickers, including one for sex trafficking and 35 for forced labor. Of these cases, in April 2021, authorities arrested and convicted a two-star military general and six other traffickers for exploiting 28 nationals from the People’s Republic of China (PRC); the court sentenced the military general to four years’ imprisonment. In comparison to this data, in 2020 the police reported authorities arrested 94 suspects—48 suspects involved in 37 cases of “non-sexual human trafficking” and 46 suspects involved in 21 cases of sex trafficking. The government prosecuted 348 cases of trafficking in 2020, but the government did not disclose the number of individuals prosecuted; it also convicted 440 traffickers. However, some of the cases reported in 2020 likely did not meet the definition of human trafficking under international law and also accounted for cases from prior years.",

Nevertheless, the government identified a total of 364 trafficking victims in 2021 after screening for trafficking among 8,370 Cambodian migrants working abroad. In comparison, the government identified 417 victims in 2020.

  "page_content": "The government did not require trafficking victims to participate in trafficking investigations or prosecutions in order to receive protection services. There were no legal provisions to offer work permits, temporary residency, or other immigration status to foreign victims wishing to remain in Cambodia to participate in civil or criminal proceedings. The government required the repatriation of foreign victims, except in rare cases, and did not provide legal alternatives to their removal regardless of whether they would face hardship or retribution upon return to their countries of origin. While awaiting repatriation, the government generally allowed foreign victims temporary residence at NGO shelters. During the previous reporting period, MOJ instructed provincial courts to implement a child-friendly judicial program allowing for video-conferencing technology as an alternative to direct cross-examination of victims in front of the accused; it did not, however, report if courts universally implemented this program in 2021. As in previous years, Cambodia’s weak and corrupt judicial system and the lack of adequate victim and witness protection, exacerbated by a lengthy trial process and fear of retaliation by traffickers, hindered victims’ willingness to cooperate in many cases. NGOs reported victims preferred out-of-court settlements over court proceedings as the fastest way to obtain monetary compensation. Cambodian law outlined channels for victim restitution, yet restitution through direct cash payments was commonly used as a method to settle criminal cases. However, restitution was difficult to obtain due to a legal requirement delaying payment until after the completion of a trafficker’s jail term; convicted traffickers’ frequent abscondment further complicated this arrangement. Observers noted Cambodia lacked a standard operating procedure for determining how to calculate restitution or compensation. Victims rarely received the amount promised, and many victims’ families settled out of court with traffickers or accepted bribes to drop the relevant charges. Nevertheless, the government cooperated with two NGOs to secure $83,200 in restitution for trafficking victims, including cases of child sexual exploitation, in 2021...PREVENTION",

  "page_content": "The government continued to provide basic care to or assist in the repatriation of Cambodian victims who were exploited abroad but relied on donor organizations to finance the repatriation. Cambodian diplomatic missions overseas also lacked adequate funding and capacity to provide basic assistance to or repatriate victims; some victims were reportedly unable to secure assistance from Cambodian consular services overseas due to unattended hotlines and unresponsive staff. Victims identified in countries without Cambodian diplomatic representation had access to even less support. In Malaysia, Cambodian officials repatriated 376 migrant workers back to Cambodia, 39 of whom officials identified as trafficking victims. The government finalized an agreement with Thailand to establish standard operating procedures (SOPs) on the repatriation and reintegration of Cambodian trafficking victims. In August 2021, the government—in cooperation with Thai authorities—identified and repatriated 21 Cambodian trafficking victims from Thailand; the government referred them for resettlement assistance. From January to September 2021, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) worked with PRC authorities to repatriate more than 300 Cambodian women who were recruited through false promises of work in the PRC and forced into marriages with PRC nationals; many of these women were likely trafficking victims. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MFAIC) facilitated the return of 10,406 undocumented Cambodian migrant workers from the PRC, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam; this compared to 10,574 returned Cambodian migrant workers during the previous reporting period. After MOSAVY conducted preliminary interviews of these returnees, it referred all of them to local NGOs for care and reintegration assistance, but—as in the previous reporting period—it did not report identifying any trafficking victims among them. The number of Cambodian returnees who experienced forced labor and sex trafficking abroad was likely much higher than reported due to insufficient victim identification procedures, as well as an increasing tendency among these groups to return via informal migration channels.",

  "page_content": "Cambodia has a high crime rate, including street crime. Military weapons and explosives are readily available to criminals despite authorities’ efforts to collect and destroy such weapons. Armed robberies occur frequently, and foreign residents and visitors, including U.S. citizens, are among the victims. The Embassy has also received reports that hotel rooms of U.S. citizen visitors in Phnom Penh were burglarized while the occupants were asleep. \r.\r.The most common type of theft is “snatch and grab” robbery, and anything that can be quickly grabbed is at risk: cameras, jewelry, purses, backpacks, mobile phones, etc.  Exercise caution and keep belongings out of sight if you travel via “tuk-tuk,” as passengers in these open-air vehicles have been targeted by thieves. If walking along the street, make yourself less of a target by carrying bags or items in your hand or on the shoulder this is furthest from the street. If someone attempts to rob you, you should surrender your valuables immediately, since any perceived resistance may be met with physical violence, including lethal force. \r.\r.Pickpockets, some of whom are beggars, are present in the markets and at tourist sites. Sometimes they may act overly friendly, placing their hand on your shoulder or back to distract you in order to pick your pocket. \r.\r.To avoid the risk of theft or confiscation of original documents, the U.S. Embassy advises its personnel and all U.S. citizens traveling to or residing in Cambodia to carry photocopies of their U.S. passport, driver's license, and other important documents and to leave the originals in a hotel safe or another secure place. Local police rarely investigate reports of crime against tourists, and travelers should not expect to recover stolen items. It has also been reported that some police stations charge foreigners from $20-$100 to file a police report.\r.\r.In 2011 and 2012, the U.S. Embassy received reports of presumed ATM/debit card fraud. ATM fraud can take place in many different ways, but the most common method is “skimming” card data as a transaction is made, while simultaneously recording the Personal Identification Number (PIN) that corresponds with the card. Several people have reported that unauthorized transactions have occurred after they have used their ATM cards in Cambodia. In light of these events, you should exercise caution by planning ahead and making copies of your ATM card, front and back, so that if you lose it, you still have the card number and contact information. Use ATMs located in secure areas, such as banks or hotel lobbies. Consider using only a few ATMs, and be aware of their appearance. If something looks unfamiliar about a machine, don’t use it until you have verified that any modification is legitimate. You should also be aware of your surroundings when using an ATM. Robberies are more likely to occur as you depart an ATM, so please stay alert to your surroundings and depart an ATM quickly.\r.\r.The U.S. Embassy advises its personnel who travel to the provinces to exercise extreme caution outside the provincial towns at all times. Many rural parts of the country remain without effective policing. Avoid walking alone after dusk anywhere in Sihanoukville, especially along the waterfront. You should be particularly vigilant during annual festivals and at tourist sites in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville, where there have been marked increases in motorcycle “snatch and grab” thefts of bags and purses.\r.\r.If you are visiting Cambodia, you should practice sound personal security awareness by varying your routes and routines, maintaining a low profile, not carrying or displaying large amounts of cash, not wearing flashy or expensive jewelry, and not walking alone after dark. In addition, you should travel by automobile and not use local moto-taxis or cyclos (passenger-carrying bicycles). These vehicles are more vulnerable to armed robberies and offer no protection against injury when involved in traffic accidents.\r.\r.Don’t buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are the ‘bootlegs’ illegal in the United States, but if you purchase them or try to bring them back into the United States you may also be breaking local or federal laws.",

Despite its recent economic growth in the past few years, it still remains one of the poorest countries in Asia. For the poor, education, vocational training and employment opportunities are insufficient to provide the income to meet minimum needs...Trafficking snapshot:..38% of women and girls working in sexually exploitative conditions had entered the industry because their virginity had been bought.1..This makes rural-to-urban and cross-border migration by vulnerable families and individuals common, as they move in search of economic opportunities to survive. In the process, many become victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation, labor exploitation, begging, or forced marriage...In a survey of Cambodian sex trafficking victims to Thailand, only 25% reported being trafficked by a stranger. Two-thirds of the victims were trafficked by someone that they knew - a family member or someone from their community.2..Other factors such as gender-based discrimination, physical and sexual violence, family dysfunction, impact of HIV/AIDS, and indebtedness also increase vulnerabilities to trafficking. Though some victims are trafficked by strangers, many more are trafficked by someone they know, suggesting that family and community members play a major role in trafficking...In a survey of trafficked victims who were returned by the International Organization for Migration, 62% reported that the main reason for migration was to find jobs to help support their family...73 suspected traffickers were arrested in Cambodia in 2005.3..Cambodia is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children trafficked into sexual exploitation and forced labor. Many Cambodian women and children are trafficked to Thailand, Malaysia, Korea, and Taiwan destined for brothels, factories or domestic labor. Cambodian men are trafficked primarily to Thailand for forced labor in the construction, agriculture, and fishing industries. A significant number of Cambodian children are trafficked to Vietnam and Thailand for the purpose of forced begging...More than 147,000 Cambodians were deported from Thailand in 2006 alone. 4",

Many Cambodians were reportedly unaware of how to apply for travel documentation or how much it should cost—leaving them at higher risk of travel through informal, more vulnerable means—and the government did not take sufficient steps to publicize that information. In 2021, the NCCT reported Cambodian soldiers and police along the Thai border prevented 3,581 Cambodian migrant workers from entering Thailand, 1,325 of whom were women and 131 were children; however, the NCCT did not report if it screened these migrants for trafficking or referred them to protection services. Officials provided food to 1,270 Cambodian migrant workers at risk of or identified as trafficking victims in Thailand and helped two workers resolve a labor dispute with a foreign employer. In South Korea, Cambodian officials made 87 visits to worksites with Cambodian workers and resolved 137 labor disputes, while in Japan Cambodian officials made 27 visits to worksites with a significant number of Cambodian workers and helped resolve 74 labor disputes. The government did not report if officials identified any trafficking victims among these labor dispute cases. The government maintained two labor recruitment agreements with Saudi Arabia, a domestic worker recruitment agreement with Hong Kong, and a bilateral cooperative agreement with India. The MFAIC continued to implement consular screening measures to reduce the sex and labor trafficking of Cambodian women via forced and fraudulent marriages, including by assessing applicants against trafficking victim profiles jointly developed with the PRC in 2016. However, the MFAIC did not report identifying potential victims during these screenings. The government also continued implementing a regulation passed in 2018 requiring foreign men to pay a fee if intending to return to their home countries with a Cambodian spouse; because this regulation only applied to air travel, observers reported an increase in the number of Cambodian women traveling through unsafe overland channels for marriage migration to the PRC.",

These trainings included 256 sessions and workshops on anti-trafficking laws, investigative techniques, and evidence collection for 12,814 law enforcement officers and seven trainings for 286 participants on victim identification and protection guidelines. Despite these trainings, many police—particularly in rural areas—remained unaware of how to conduct anti-trafficking work, as most did not receive training on basic law enforcement techniques. Moreover, law enforcement and judicial officials lacked the necessary equipment to handle trafficking cases appropriately, including vehicles, computer and communications equipment, and forensic tools. Additionally, the government required the funding of all anti-trafficking investigative work to be conducted through reimbursement, forcing individual police units to personally cover relevant expenses. NGO contacts reported some officers waited months for this reimbursement, which was sometimes not repaid in full, and that the ensuing financial hardships made some police units more susceptible to corruption. Local organizations and some officials continued to stress an urgent need for more sophisticated evidence collection techniques—including more undercover investigations—to decrease reliance on witness testimony and improve efforts to detect and combat sex trafficking.

  "page_content": "All of Cambodia’s 25 provinces are sources for human trafficking. Sex trafficking is largely clandestine; Cambodian and ethnic Vietnamese women and girls move from rural areas to cities and tourist destinations, where criminals exploit them in sex trafficking in brothels and, more frequently, clandestine sex establishments at beer gardens, massage parlors, salons, karaoke bars, retail spaces, and non-commercial sites. In recent years, the rapidly growing and largely unregulated presence of PRC national-owned casinos, entertainment establishments, and other commercial enterprises in Preah Sihanouk Province led to an increase of local sex trafficking and forced labor among Cambodian women and girls, although Cambodia’s 2020 ban on online gambling and the subsequent shuttering of many PRC national-owned casinos and other entertainment establishments has reduced such trafficking. Cambodian men form the largest source of demand for children exploited in sex trafficking; however, men from elsewhere in Asia, Australia, Europe, South Africa, and the United States travel to Cambodia to engage in child sex tourism, increasingly facilitated through social media contact. Thousands of urban children left behind by families migrating abroad for work are particularly vulnerable to sex trafficking and forced labor. The prevalence of child sex trafficking and child sex tourism reportedly declined in 2020 due to reduced international travel and pandemic-related quarantine requirements. However, NGOs and law enforcement officials reported the pandemic increased incidents of online child sexual exploitation in 2020, and incidents continued to increase through 2021. Vietnamese women and children, many of whom are victims of debt-based coercion, travel to Cambodia and are exploited in sex trafficking. NGOs report that criminal gangs transport some Vietnamese victims through Cambodia before they are exploited in Thailand and Malaysia. Traffickers in Cambodia are most commonly family or community members or small networks of independent brokers. Some Cambodian orphanages purchase local children from economically disadvantaged families and subject them to malnutrition and unclean living conditions in their facilities for the purpose of attracting and profiting from charitable donations; some of these children are at further risk of sex trafficking and domestic servitude as a result of poor government oversight of adoption processes...Tags..Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs",

Observers noted the high costs, complex administrative requirements, and restrictive provisions inherent to the formal migration process drove a majority of Cambodian labor migrants to pursue informal pathways to working abroad. The MOLVT held 75 training sessions for recruitment agencies and labor brokers on ethical recruitment practices to protect the rights of migrant workers. The government worked in cooperation with an international organization to conduct labor inspections of garment factories, but a COVID-19 outbreak in February 2021 suspended in-person inspections, and the government had to rely on virtual assessments for the remainder of the year. Nevertheless, MOLVT and MOI officials conducted 2,966 inspections at factories and other businesses where they found 28,863 foreign workers, of whom 466 were without legal work documentation; the government fined the businesses a total of 233 million riels ($58,520) for labor violations. The MOLVT maintained offices at the provincial level to monitor recruitment agencies and address complaints from workers, including potential incidents of trafficking; however, it did not report how many complaints these offices received in 2021. The government also did not conduct inspections of recruitment agencies that were allegedly involved in trafficking crimes.",

  "page_content": "TRAFFICKING PROFILE..As reported over the past five years, human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Cambodia, and traffickers exploit victims from Cambodia abroad. NGOs and labor unions reported in 2020 that foreign labor brokers are fraudulently recruiting foreign migrants, including from Bangladesh, the PRC, and Nepal, to work in PRC-invested and other construction sites in Cambodia where some are indebted to recruitment firms and experience passport confiscation. In 2021, the media reported that traffickers also subject PRC, Southeast Asian, and other country nationals to forced criminality in online scam operations run by local PRC-organized criminal groups in call centers located in Cambodia. Cambodian adults and children migrate to other countries within the region and increasingly to the Middle East for work; traffickers force many to work on fishing vessels, in agriculture, in construction, in factories, and in domestic service—often through debt-based coercion—or exploit them in sex trafficking. Migrants using irregular migration channels, predominantly with the assistance of unlicensed brokers, are at an increased risk of trafficking, although those using licensed recruiting agents also become victims of forced labor or sex trafficking. Companies operating under the auspices of the Japanese government’s “Technical Intern Training Program” have exploited Cambodian nationals in forced labor in food processing, manufacturing, construction, and fishing. Children from impoverished families are vulnerable to forced labor, often with the complicity of their families, including in domestic service and forced begging or street vending in Thailand and Vietnam. Undocumented Cambodian labor migrants working in Thailand—who constituted an estimated 30-40 percent of the 1.5 to 2 million Cambodians there before the pandemic—are at high risk of trafficking due to their immigration status, as are undocumented Cambodians working in Vietnam. The pandemic affected established migration patterns and certain sectors in 2020, such as construction, which placed some vulnerable groups at greater risk of trafficking than in previous years. Between February 2020 to February 2021, more than 150,000 Cambodian labor migrants returned to Cambodia from other countries, primarily Thailand, due to industry closures caused by the pandemic.",

The government organized 192 anti-trafficking awareness raising campaigns across the country, incorporated anti-trafficking messaging in thousands of public events (such as town halls and community council meetings), and senior officials spoke publicly about human trafficking. In 2021, the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports—in cooperation with NGOs—implemented a school curriculum to educate students and teachers about human trafficking. The Anti-Human Trafficking Juvenile Police (AHTJP) and MOI continued to operate a hotline for victims and witnesses to report human trafficking crimes; the government publicized the hotline on government websites and social media sites, required guesthouses and hotels in all 25 provinces to publicize the hotline, and worked with an NGO focused on child sex trafficking to place placards of the hotline number in taxis and tuk-tuks throughout the country. The government reported the hotline received 21 calls—the same number of calls during the last reporting period—but none of them were human trafficking cases. The AHTJP also continued to utilize its social media site for the public to report suspected incidents of human trafficking, but it did not report how many cases it received. The Ministries of Labor and Foreign Affairs operated hotlines for Cambodians working abroad to seek assistance and report cases of human trafficking; the Cambodian embassy in Thailand received 1,109 calls, the embassy in South Korea received 186 calls, and the embassy in Japan received 540 calls. However, the government did not report if any of these calls resulted in the identification of trafficking victims.",

In some cases, local or provincial authorities neglected cases of complicity, so national authorities intervened to investigate and prosecute such cases. During the reporting period, NGOs reported trafficking victims accused Cambodian officials of colluding with labor brokers to commit human trafficking crimes. NGOs alleged police and other officials were complicit in online scam operations that forced hundreds of PRC, Southeast Asian, and other foreign nationals to work in call centers in Sihanoukville and other locations. Observers alleged prosecutors and judges accepted bribes in return for dismissal of charges, acquittals, and reduced sentencing. Corrupt officials often thwarted progress in cases where the perpetrators were believed to have political, criminal, or economic ties to government officials. Despite consistent credible allegations of complicity in human trafficking crimes, the government did not prosecute or convict the large majority of complicit government employees. Law enforcement raids on sex trafficking establishments were sometimes unsuccessful due to advance warning from working-level police. Some police reportedly protected sex trafficking establishments in exchange for monthly payments from the business owners or sexual favors from the victims. Authorities often overlooked, denied, or downplayed labor abuses—including forced child labor—in factories and at brick kilns and colluded with brick manufacturers to arrest, jail, and return indentured laborers who had attempted to escape.",

The United States is now a net exporter of natural gas, but we’re still a significant net importer of crude oil. We’re still exposed to global oil prices and we know that high gasoline prices here are incredibly politically unpopular. I think that the public believes that the government has more control over oil prices than it actually does, and that can be a real problem for the incumbent administration during times of high oil prices.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is that the region is still important not just to our economic stability, but to global economic stability. But as United States has been marketed as a new global oil superpower, particularly by the current administration, the American public has lost its desire to take care of “our oil.” The world is certainly still dependent on Middle Eastern oil, and we’re still somewhat dependent on it, but we’re losing our political will to take care of that in the way we used to, and it’s not clear what will fill that gap.\n\nBRUCE JONES: Well there is another actor in this region that we tend not to think about, which is Beijing. China is now the largest consumer of oil from the Middle East, has huge stakes in the flow of oil from the region, and has begun to invest in instruments that can over time build influence in the region.\n\nBut Samantha, have we reached a point where American swing production is able to compensate for some degree of instability in the global energy market? To compensate for outages in Libya or Yemen or Syria, though likely not Saudi Arabia? Is that right?\n\nSAMANTHA GROSS: That’s right. We definitely have more ability to take up slack than we used to because of the type of oil production that’s happening here in the United States. The important thing about U.S. shale production is that it can respond to prices much more quickly than production that we had before, and you can see new production come on line in maybe six to nine months.

  "page_content": "After the accession of King Salman to the Saudi throne, Turkey developed close relations with Muhammad bin Nayef and managed to sustain a collaborative relationship against all odds. However, once Mohammed bin Salman successfully maneuvered himself into the position of crown prince in July 2017, the picture began to change dramatically and the Saudi-Turkish relationship became increasingly strained. This coincided with an escalating crisis between the two sides when Saudi Arabia together with Bahrain, the UAE, and Egypt severed all ties with Qatar and imposed an economic blockade over Qatar’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood and its refusal to terminate its ties with Iran. In response, Turkey sent additional troops to its small military base in Qatar as a deterrent against a possible Saudi military intervention, which would seek the overthrown of Tamim al Thani, the emir of Qatar. Turkey further deepened its ties with Qatar establishing a new food logistic line via Iran, enabling it to withstand the blockade. Yet, what aggravated matters for Erdoğan most were Mohammed bin Salman’s policies toward Israel, his willingness to entertain Trump’s Middle East peace plan with Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, his close relationship with Jared Kushner, and his decision to pledge $100 million to help with reconstruction in northeastern parts of Syria controlled by U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds.\n\nThe murder of Khashoggi thus became a golden opportunity for Erdoğan to embark on an ambitious project and seek a change in the line of succession to the Saudi throne by discrediting the legitimacy of the crown prince. The whole Khashoggi affair has benefitted Erdoğan domestically as well as internationally, even though it is not evident that he succeeded in achieving his ambition to see Mohammed bin Salman removed from power. Yet, throughout the saga, Erdoğan kept King Salman out of the scandal and showed deference by referring to him as the custodian of the holy mosques. This suggests that for the time being Erdoğan is likely to continue to seek a pragmatic relationship with Saudi Arabia, especially at a time when Turkey is going through economic difficulties and needs Saudi finance and trade. However, the presence of Mohammed bin Salman at the helm of Saudi foreign policy will ensure that both sides remain locked in a major rivalry as far as the future of Middle East geopolitics is concerned.\n\nfinal word",

But it does at least dampen and reduce the duration of price shocks, though it can’t eliminate all of those effects.\n\nSUZANNE MALONEY: Still, returning to the political sensitivity of oil prices, how do you reconcile forcing Iran’s oil production off the market with maintaining low domestic oil prices? Saudi Arabia has some spare capacity but they can’t necessarily deploy it quickly to the market. It doesn’t leave a lot of flexibility in the markets for disruptions from Nigeria, Libya, or a number of other wild cards.\n\nSAMANTHA GROSS: Or collapsing Venezuelan production.\n\nSUZANNE MALONEY: Right. There is an inherent paradox in the desire to have very low oil prices for domestic political purposes and a desire to use oil or oil exports as a lever for pressuring adversarial countries. You can’t achieve both at the same time.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL: The Iran example points to another odd thing. Since 1979, no Middle Eastern country has taken oil off the market. Only the United States has taken oil off the market. It’s been American sanctions against Iraq, Libya, and Iran, and now Iran again, that have reduced oil on the market. It isn’t the region that’s a threat to the market. If you look at the historical record of the last quarter century, it’s the United States of America that’s a threat to the market.\n\nSUZANNE MALONEY: And that’s a huge shift. Think of the concern well into and beyond the 1970s and 1980s about the willingness of Middle Eastern leaders to use oil as a weapon. It is the United States that has used oil as a weapon.\n\nSAMANTHA GROSS: Well, the first time we did the Iran sanctions, before the JCPOA was signed, one of the reasons why the United States was able to so strongly sanction, and get the world on board with the sanctions, was because of rapidly rising U.S. oil production at the time, which really dampened the price impact. Whereas now, with things going wrong in other parts of the world and demand increasing, there isn’t quite that much leeway. There seems to be this desire to have our cake and eat it too in terms of taking Iranian oil production off the market and wanting low oil prices.",

Yet while it’s easy to focus on Trump’s unwillingness to rein in the Saudis in Yemen, this war began during the Obama administration. It was the Obama administration that directly engaged and expanded the U.S. role in the war. Fundamentally, it’s a function of this difficult relationship between Washington and Riyadh, and our unwillingness and/or inability to impose constraints on a partner and an important ally, which happens to be a country with deep domestic and regional issues that we should not implicate ourselves in.\n\nTAMARA COfMAN WITTES: It is worth contemplating that when the Obama administration came in and focused on stabilizing Iraq and peacemaking between Israelis and Palestinians, it was operating to an extent on old premises about the Middle East, that stabilizing Iraq and working Arab-Israeli peace was enough to keep the region in a good place and let the United States pivot to Asia.\n\nThat premise was based on false assumptions about the roots of instability in the region, and we saw that erupt in 2011 with the Arab uprisings. The real roots of instability in the region were coming from the bottom up, from demographic challenges, failed governance, failed economic programs, and the forces of globalization impacting the region, the information environment, and the economy in ways that these states couldn’t control. That was a set of assumptions that never worked their way into the early Obama policy for the Middle East. They sort of landed on the doorstep of the Obama administration, and I think forced a recalculation.\n\n26\n\nForeign Policy at Brookings\n\nthe new geopolitics of the middle east: america’s role in a changing region\n\nAnd so the challenge that Obama faced in his second term, that I think Trump faces and future American presidents will face, is not how do we back away from the Middle East, but can we back away from the Middle East. And if we can’t do so without destabilizing it further, what are we willing to invest in stabilizing it.",

I don’t think that Russia goes out of its way to produce instability vis-à-vis the impact on oil prices, but instability that drives oil prices up is not something they have to worry about.\n\nAnd then there’s the kind of strange Erdoğan-Putin dynamic, which has been very tense at times, then an effort at rapprochement.

Kirill Kudryavtsev/Pool via REUTERS\n\nAMANDA SLOAT: Turkey and Russia have a complicated relationship. Nowhere is this illustrated more clearly than in Syria, where they are on different sides of the conflict with Putin backing the Assad regime and Erdoğan supporting the opposition. Their relations hit a low point in November 2015 when Turkey downed a Russian fighter jet for violating its airspace. Erdoğan remarkably apologized to Putin seven months later, after suffering from painful economic sanctions and more importantly given Ankara’s need for Moscow’s acquiescence to a Turkish military operation to prevent the Syrian Kurds from creating a contiguous region alongside its border. A major crisis was averted recently in Idlib, as Turkey and Russia agreed to enforce a new demilitarized zone, but tensions could easily flare up again.\n\nMARTIN INDYK: In contrast with the United States’ withdrawal, Putin is engaged in a very deliberate effort to fill any resulting gaps, starting with Syria, even if it was never of great strategic importance to the United States. The Russians were able to use a military presence there to gain outsized influence across the region precisely because of its military engagement at a time when the United States is withdrawing militarily.

And as Bruce Riedel has written,1 it has been involved in military adventures and misadventures for a lot longer than that. But I think there’s no real doubt that there have been two qualitative shifts in the past couple of years.\n\nOne is the wider breakdown of regional order and dramatic intensification of violence in the region since the Arab Spring took a wrong turn, so to speak.2 If you look at the 2000s, about 8 percent of all global battle deaths occurred in the Middle East. In the last five years, it’s grown to 70 percent. To put it in starker terms, if you include Afghanistan and a wider arc of instability, 95 percent of all global battle deaths over the past five years have been in majority-Muslim countries. You hear talk about a global upturn in violence and conflict—that’s not true. Conflict is on the decline in every region of the world except for the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nThe second major trend, which is harder to quantify, is the qualitative shift in the perception of America’s role and presence—a broad perception of America pulling back or not carrying the weight it once did. Whether it’s empirically true or not, there’s clearly a broad perception of that.\n\nThose strike me as the two key developments, but against a backdrop of huge economic growth in countries like Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Russia in the 2000s, and economic doldrums in Egypt long before the Arab Spring, made worse by it. We thus have a very different texture to the geopolitics of the region, and that’s where I want to start.\n\nNatan, how would you frame the geopolitics of the Middle East today?",

If we think of the proxy wars, a lot of what is happening is being perpetrated by groups that are outside the influence of any one actor. And that’s a big part of the problem and a big part of the calculation of all the other actors: how do we deal with these ungoverned groups, with al-Qaida types, ISIS affiliates, or anyone else. The Arab Spring led to the disintegration of a lot of state capacity. Those governments that remain are the ones that are now playing on this field. But the disintegration of Iraq, Syria, and Libya, that’s where you get this abyss. And that’s a crucial element. It’s not quite proxy wars, it’s really wars against this morass. And it very much affects the way the Russians, Egyptians, Israelis, nearly everyone, think of things.\n\nBRUCE JONES: We’ve gone away from a phase in geopolitics where the major powers saw, at least in the main, a common interest in working together to tamp down civil wars.

More than 90 percent of all battle deaths in civil wars in the last five years have been in places where a terrorist group is one of the principal actors in the fight. People say, “Oh, all the powers share an interest in squashing terrorism,” but it’s not the reality. Instead of cooperating, interested actors get involved via proxies, which fuels and actually amplifies the dynamics of violence. We’ve seen a continuous increase in the scale of violence in these contexts where terrorism and civil war fuse, and we’re paralyzed into a dynamic of amplifying the proxy warfare rather than resolving it.",

This entire conceptualization of how the United States would assert power in the Middle East has always been, if not entirely reliant, at least primarily contingent upon local regional states that were close partners, in most cases not allies, through which we exerted influence and were always to some extent distorted through that relationship. What is different—or perhaps what’s notable—is that it’s not just the Iranians that use proxies, it’s also the United States. We’re spending a billion dollars a year in Syria. This idea that we weren’t present in Syria is simply untrue. We may not have been able to produce the outcome we wanted, but the idea that we were a completely missing actor in the evolution of that conflict is one of the most dangerous myths about the Obama administration’s approach to that conflict.\n\nIt’s also important to appreciate how all of these actors, including Iran, are shaping their responses based on an American state that has been, through several administrations, erratic, unpredictable, and in many ways destructive. We’re always talking about Iran’s destabilizing activities. The reality is that the greatest destabilization in the Middle East in the past 20 years has been the United States’ decision to invade Iraq and its subsequent failure to appreciate how regional actors would respond. It’s not an absolution for how Iranians have sought to assert themselves through violence and groups that are prone to trying to destroy rather than to build. But fundamentally, if you remove that episode, then I think you have a very different set of dynamics in the region today. We seem unwilling to recognize that our role in these ongoing conflicts is enormous.",

Since the 1979 revolution, the Iranians have felt isolated in their region and in the world. They perceive themselves to be an embattled revolutionary state, a government that the United States and other world powers would like to eradicate if possible. And so they seek to extend their influence wherever possible.\n\nThere is an ideological dimension to it; in both the Iranian Constitution and the mindset of the leadership, the invocation to export the revolution has always been a priority. The Islamic revolution for Iranians was never intended to be a revolution in one country, it was intended and conceived of as something that would radiate throughout the Islamic world and beyond because of the anti-imperialist world view of the revolutionary leadership.",

And if there are troubling aspects about Donald Trump’s behavior in the Middle East, to Saudis and other Arabs, Mike Pence is a nightmare come true because he’ll do anything to fulfill what evangelical Americans want Israel to be. I think there’s nervousness now about what comes after Trump. And if they were more sophisticated they’d also be thinking, “What have we done to our relationship with the Democrats?” It may be very, very hard to rebuild if you get a Democratic president in the future.\n\nSUZANNE MALONEY: Is there a recognition among the Saudis that irrespective of Mueller or who controls the White House, there’s no appetite among the American people for an expanded military footprint or human commitment to the Middle East?\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL: The Saudis aren’t looking for the United States to counter Iran on each of the battlefields, they’re looking for the United States to depose the regime in Tehran, not by trying to fight it in Hodeidah and Idlib, where you’re playing into Iran’s advantage. That may be delusional, but I think that’s what their hope is.\n\nMARTIN INDYK: Just like we did in Iraq.\n\nBRUCE JONES: But does that necessarily, in their mind, involve American military action or are they sympathetic to what appears to be a pretty strong effort by this administration to use a variety of economic tools to achieve something like that result?\n\n19\n\nForeign Policy at Brookings\n\nthe new geopolitics of the middle east: america’s role in a changing region",

  "page_content": "TAMARA COfMAN WITTES: Let me start by pivoting off a point that I think Bruce and Natan were both getting at in a way: in different ways, Saudi Arabia and Israel can act with a lot of capacity in the region, but it’s capacity that’s limited to certain dimensions. Israel has a lot of military and intelligence capability, but its diplomatic engagement with the rest of the region is constrained. Saudi Arabia has a lot of soft power, it’s got a lot of money, it’s got a lot of convening power, but it doesn’t have military power.\n\nAnd in different ways each of those capitals has traditionally relied on the United States to backstop its constrained capacity in those other dimensions. And one of the challenges for the region right now, and for those two actors, is that they’re not sure whether they can rely on Washington to backstop them in that traditional way.\n\nBRUCE JONES: Natan, while rapprochement is too strong of a term, we’ve observed significant easing of the rhetoric between Israel and Saudi Arabia. How does this look from Israel? Is there a sense of Saudi Arabia as a potential partner, or is it just opportunistic cooperation with a diminished threat?\n\nNATAN SACHS: It’s mostly opportunistic, but the change is pretty dramatic. It’s not just rhetoric, you can see it in internal communications and curricula in Saudi Arabia, which for Israel is a very real and important thing, and even closer relations with the Emiratis. Still, I don’t think anyone has any grand illusions about a great love affair. Israel is sort of the mistress of the Middle East where everyone wants to be with it but no one wants to admit it, at least thus far. This could change, though, as so much has recently.\n\nBut I think for Netanyahu and for others, there’s a very strong sense that this is a product of Israeli strength. Netanyahu recently changed course and has spoken of strategic long-term growth in military expenditure by Israel, even as a percentage of GDP. This is a dramatic change for Netanyahu, ideologically, from an economic standpoint—he’s the real economic neo-liberal and fiscal hawk of Israel. And part of the rationale is that military strength is key to why they have gained diplomatically with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and even as far afield as India.",

Saudi Arabia may have more aspirations for regional leadership today than it has ever had. Witness that they just signed a peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea in Saudi Arabia, and brought in Djibouti as well. The prime minister of Pakistan made his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, and President Trump made his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. Yet while the Saudis are definitely very active diplomatically, questions about the stability of the Kingdom are higher now that they’ve been in 50 years. And there is a very serious question about what the line of succession is going to produce, and whether it will be disrupted by some kind of internal political upheaval. It is very fascinating that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has spent the last four months sleeping every night on a yacht off Jeddah in the Red Sea because he doesn’t feel safe sleeping on the ground.\n\nJEffREY fELTMAN: When the crown prince is floating on his yacht in the Red Sea, he must also be thinking about the economic and financial future of Saudi Arabia, not just counter-revolution in the region. Unlike the United Arabia Emirates or Qatar or even Kuwait, Saudi Arabia lacks the long-term comfort level of having used its energy resources to build up sizable financial reserves. So he must also be looking at the economic situation, which would explain the Ritz Carlton shakedown with some of the businesses.\n\nBRUCE JONES: Let’s turn to Turkey. It seems to me that a central and surely driving concern of Turkish engagement in the Middle East is its internal politics, including the role of President Erdoğan and a repositioning of Turkish domestic politics toward Islam. Kemal and Amanda, what are Turkey’s strategic objectives in the Middle East?\n\nKEMAL KIRIŞCI: First of all, it’s Erdoğan’s strategy, not Turkey’s. The easiest way to capture his strategic perspective is reflected by two different hand gestures he frequently employs. From about 2012 to about nine or ten months ago, Erdogan’s strategic perspective on the Middle East was symbolized by the four-finger Rabia salute, denoting solidarity with the Muslim Brotherhood. From this you can deduce the poor relations with Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia, the close relations with Qatar, and Turkey’s ambiguous, confusing policies over Libya.",

  "page_content": "AMANDA SLOAT: Bruce is right—Europeans are angry and this issue will be damaging to our bilateral relations there. They don’t like American extraterritorial sanctions to begin with. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas even went so far as musing about developing an alternative banking system to SWIFT, given the effect that U.S. sanctions have on this international payment mechanism. Yet Europeans implemented their own sanctions on Iran during the Obama administration, with this pressure campaign leading Iran to the negotiating table and resulting in a deal that—as Suzanne just said—Tehran is still implementing. There is no appetite in Europe to start this process over again. Europeans also felt like they made a good faith effort to engage with senior administration officials—as well as Trump himself—to address his concerns about the deal and Iran’s regional activities, but to no avail.\n\nBRUCE JONES: So in sum, we have a less influential United States; a weaker trans-Atlantic alliance; a divided GCC; activism by Turkey and Israel, no longer aligned with each other and sometimes misaligned with the United States; and above all, rising tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Together, it’s hardly a recipe for stability in the region!\n\nclosing notes\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL: The premeditated murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018 has reshuffled the politics of the region. The Saudi crown prince is on the defensive and Turkish President Erdoğan is driving a campaign to weaken Mohammed bin Salman if not remove him from the line of succession. The Trump administration has thrown itself behind the crown prince while the American public, media, and Congress want the prince sanctioned and the war in Yemen halted.\n\nKhashoggi was an opinion writer for the Washington Post living in exile in Virginia. He was a longtime aide to Prince Turki al Faisal, and was at the consulate to get some paperwork for his marriage. Inside the consulate a team of assassins were waiting. His body has not been found.\n\nThe Saudis reacted with a series of weak and crude cover stories. The Trump administration has not challenged the Saudi versions and has specifically exonerated Mohammed bin Salman. The implications of the affair are still playing out.\n\nIn broad terms, the affair reinforces the importance of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and indirectly Iran in regional dynamics (Israel is a bit player on this). Turkey and Iran have gained influence at the Saudis’ expense.",

  "page_content": "And it’s interesting because I think it’s an example of decisions that Mohammed bin Salman has made that had the opposite result of what was intended. The Iranian influence in Yemen is greater now than it was before the war. Qatar’s relationship with Turkey is stronger than it was before the boycott. So I think that the Saudi decisionmaking is often producing the results that were least intended.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL: Of all the proxy wars, the real prize is Iraq. That’s where the oil is, that’s where the natural gas is, that’s where there’s a population that’s large enough to be significant. As I said earlier, Iraq will come back at some point. Will it come back as an Iranian puppet? Probably not. Will it come back as an Iranian ally? There’s probably a good chance of that. The Iranians benefited enormously from our decision to go into Iraq, and their proxies there are getting stronger and stronger. There is resentment against Iranians, seen clearly in Basra recently, but I think the overall tilt is toward Iran. The Iranians have to play this very carefully, not overplay their hand. They’re pretty skilled at this game though. They’ve learned over the years how to play it very well.\n\nDespite all the disastrous decisions in Yemen, Qatar, Libya, and other places, the place where Saudi Arabia was said to be playing a smart role is in Iraq. I wonder if that has now backfired. Part of the reason we see the Iranians and Iranian protégés in Iraq playing tougher ball is because the minute they began to see that the Saudis wanted to play, they said, “Okay, we can’t let that happen, we’re going to whack them back down.” That’s the proxy war that I think we really should keep our eyes on the most.\n\nMARTIN INDYK: I don’t know whether you referred to the United States in the context of proxy wars, but the United States is essentially using Saudi Arabia, Israel, and to a lesser extent Egypt, as proxies for American influence in the region. This demonstrates that the absence of U.S. diplomatic initiative in all of these areas results in our dependence on these local actors, and we’re unable to achieve the objectives that we share with them.\n\n21\n\nForeign Policy at Brookings\n\nthe new geopolitics of the middle east: america’s role in a changing region",

Unlike in Soviet times, Russian policy is pragmatic and non-ideological, which gives it considerable flexibility. Russia has ties with all the major regional players, irrespective of their internal politics. Indeed, Russia is the only major power that talks to the Shiite states, the Sunni states, and to Israel. It has been able to establish cooperative ties with the region’s main protagonists and antagonists: Israel and the Palestinians; Israel and Iran; Iran and Saudi Arabia; Turkey and the Kurds; both Libyan governments; and Hamas and Hezbollah. Putin has taken advantage of the U.S. ambivalence about its future role in the region to re-assert Russia’s influence there. Indeed, Russia has begun to replace the United States as the go-to player in this fractured region. Its intervention in Syria and support for Assad have enabled Putin to achieve one of his major goals—Russia’s return to the global board of directors. Russia is in the Middle East for the long haul. It is seeking to convert its decisive role in Syria—ensuring that Assad prevailed and stayed in power—to a broader role of regional power broker. But there is also a domestic element here. Russia has an ongoing problem with radicalization and jihadism amongst its Muslim population—20 million and growing. The Kremlin viewed the Arab Spring, particularly what happened in Libya, as a dangerous precedent for what could happen elsewhere—including in Russia. Putin has given the figure of 4,000 people who have gone from Russia to fight with ISIS. Russia wants to ensure that these jihadists do not return home and it seeks to minimize the ability of foreign terrorist groups to radicalize Russian citizens.",

But that was insufficient to all of our regional allies, and it was insufficient to at least half the American body politic.

They’ve received an enormous number of Syrian refugees, and that’s after the Iraqis and after the Palestinians.\n\nAMANDA SLOAT: I want to reinforce that point on Turkey. For all the criticism that we level against Ankara, the Turks have not gotten sufficient credit for their extraordinary efforts to manage a complex humanitarian challenge. A population of 80 million people is currently hosting over 3.5 million refugees.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL: I think of Jordan as the shock absorber of the Middle East. Whenever there is a dramatic new conflict, whether it’s Iraq in 2003, or Iraq and Kuwait in 1990, or the Syrian civil war, or troubles on the West Bank, Jordan is the place that takes in the exiles, and in a way takes some pressure out of the system. The problem is, and Natan rightly put it, we’ve now asked them to do this three times in a row, and I think there is less and less grounds for stability in Jordan. If I were to say, “what’s the unknown event in the next five to 10 years that could dramatically change the Middle East?,” it would be the downfall of the Hashemite monarchy.

The second is this sense of a Turkey-Iran-Qatar axis arrayed against a U.S.-Israel-Saudi-UAE axis. Both of those depictions strike me as over- simplified. So let’s try to unpack some of it.\n\nLet’s first think about what is the texture of the relationship now between the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia vis-à-vis the Iran question.

Israel will quickly come to realize the limits to its ambitions in Syria because of the absence of the United States.\n\nIn Yemen, the Saudis need an active American effort to get them the hell out of there. It’s the only way it’s going to work. And yet we’re not willing to do anything but supply weaponry.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL: I want to underscore this point. If you think about smart American politics in this region, helping the Saudis get out of the morass that they’ve created in Yemen is probably the biggest thing we could do in the near term to help stabilize the Kingdom and stabilize the Arabian Peninsula. And it’s doable. We have the means. If we call the Saudis up tonight and say “Cease fire tomorrow at 6:00 or no arms deliveries starting at 6:01,” they’ll say, “Yeah, okay, we got it.” They would have no choice.\n\nNATAN SACHS: That would have a huge human benefit in Yemen.

  "page_content": "SUZANNE MALONEY: I agree with the critique.\n\nIt’s an important to remember that the deal became a theological issue here in Washington. If you were pro- Obama, you were pro-nuclear deal—you believed it was inviolable and criticism of it was inconceivable. And you had the same dynamics on the other side of the domestic debate. Unfortunately, that created the sense that preserving the deal was the entirety of U.S. policy toward Iran during the Obama administration, and that we had to go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that we preserved the deal because certainly in the minds of some Obama officials, it was the vehicle through which a broader set of agreements could be made with Iran.\n\nThat’s never how the Iranians genuinely thought about it, and it was never realistic. But the efforts that the administration went to in order to reinforce Iran’s commitment to staying in the deal, we now see that was totally unnecessary. Since Trump withdrew, they’re getting no incentives, and they’re sticking by their commitments. So the roadshow that the Treasury put on, John Kerry’s efforts to try to talk up business in Iran after the implementation of the deal, were totally unnecessary. And meanwhile those efforts contributed to the sense of betrayal among our allies—that it wasn’t just a transaction, that it was in fact an American effort to make peace wholeheartedly with Iran.\n\nMARTIN INDYK: If Hillary Clinton had won the election, the policy would have been much stronger than Obama against Iran’s efforts to destabilize the region. The Clinton team had in mind to renegotiate the deal eventually as well. In those circumstances, Netanyahu would have adjusted to the new administration’s approach, but I don’t believe that he would have gone hell for leather to destroy the deal.\n\nSUZANNE MALONEY: No, and the Iranians would have walked away from it under those circumstances.\n\nMARTIN INDYK: A far better thing to happen.\n\nJEffREY fELTMAN: There was never a consistent narrative on the Iran nuclear deal. On the one hand you’d hear the administration saying this is just about one of the issues, this is just about the nuclear program. The other narrative was this is the start of something much bigger. That second narrative simply was never going to be realistic, that this was going to open the door to some great Washington-Tehran understanding about the regime and everything else. It was that second narrative that really scared our Gulf allies.",

  "page_content": "BRUCE RIEDEL: I think there are four principal Saudi objectives.\n\nThe first is to counter Iran. The Saudis see Iran as their principal threat in the region, and they rapidly go from countering Iran to countering Shi’ism. This is rooted deeply in Wahhabi ideology. There’s virtually no difference in their minds between the two.\n\nThe second is counter-revolution, and by that I mean countering moves toward democratic political reforms in the region, which Saudi Arabia is adamantly against. Saudi Arabia makes no secret it is an absolute monarchy and has no intention of ever becoming a democratic state.\n\nThe third is counterterrorism. Here there’s a paradox of course. Saudi Arabia is determined to fight terrorist groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State, which target Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia is also, because of its Wahhabi ideology, often the petri dish in which radical Islamic ideas flourish, particularly in the Muslim communities in Europe.\n\nThe fourth is to counter Israel. Although here I think there are more signs of confusion within the Kingdom than we’ve seen heretofore.\n\nI make two overall comments about this. From the Saudi standpoint, many of these issues overlap. A good example is the intervention in Bahrain in 2011, which was undertaken to counter Iran, counter democratic reforms, counter Shi’ism, and, since anyone who is espousing all of those things must be a terrorist, to counter terrorism as well. They only lacked an Israeli angle. And I’m sure if they tried, they could have found one.\n\nThe other thing I would say is that when you look at issue number one—countering Iran—the sorry story for the Saudis is that they’re losing, and losing badly. Lebanon and Syria were essentially lost to the Iranians in the 1980s, and the Syrian civil war has just moved them even further out of the Saudi orbit. Iraq was lost by the disastrous decision of the George W. Bush administration to intervene and then to foolishly hold elections, which guaranteed a Shiite takeover, at least from the Saudi standpoint. Yemen is a more complicated story, but the bottom line there is that the Saudis have gotten themselves into a quagmire that costs them billions of dollars a month, and costs the Iranians, at most, a couple of million dollars a month. If anyone was to look at this as a corporate entity, they would say this is a disastrous decision for you to make.\n\n10\n\nForeign Policy at Brookings",

They believed that if you bring Iran more into the world, Iran would therefore find more incentives to moderate. But it’s precisely the opposite. The Iranians have been able to do business with the entire world unimpeded, except for U.S. economic pressure, for the past 40 years without changing any elements of the way they approached the region or the way they approached their own population.\n\n29\n\nForeign Policy at Brookings\n\nthe new geopolitics of the middle east: america’s role in a changing region\n\nAnd so there was never any likelihood that rehabilitation economically and the removal of the European and multilateral sanctions and some American sanctions were going to somehow create pressures within Iran, which would then cause them to sort of back out of Syria or change their approach to Yemen or any other conflict.\n\nBRUCE JONES: Interestingly, we haven’t really discussed our European allies in the context of the Middle East today. I’d like to add a point here. I was in Berlin recently and was struck by the degree of anger among the Berlin elite at the extent of public American political pressure on German companies not to do business in Iran. And this leads to an erosion in Berlin-Washington relations that has consequences.\n\nSUZANNE MALONEY: Germany historically was Iran’s largest trade partner in the world. It was overtaken by China recently, but Iran still has major diplomatic and economic stakes in Europe.",

  "page_content": "TAMARA COfMAN WITTES: I agree with Martin that the greater investment of military presence followed diplomacy and is a necessary adjunct to diplomacy. The large-scale presence of military force that began in the 1990s was an outgrowth of the Gulf War and the need for containment after the war all the way through 2003 and beyond. But inevitably, when that military presence began to scale down after the surge during the Iraq War, the perception of governments in the region was of military withdrawal because relatively speaking, that’s how it looked.\n\n5\n\nForeign Policy at Brookings\n\nthe new geopolitics of the middle east: america’s role in a changing region\n\nAMANDA SLOAT: This is reflected in the late and limited American military role in Syria, as President Obama saw American fatigue with Middle East conflicts and was reluctant to put boots on the ground there. He decided not to get involved in the Syrian civil war. He only sent troops—and even then a small number of special operators— to serve primarily as advisors to local partners in the fight against the Islamic State, given the group’s threat to the American homeland and regional allies.\n\nSUZANNE MALONEY: It was the Iran-Iraq War that brought the United States into the Persian Gulf in a much more substantive way. The story of American involvement in the Middle East that Martin has told is seen largely through the prioritization of the Middle East peace process in American strategy in the area. But in many ways, that’s not the only story of American involvement in the Middle East, and in some ways it’s the declining story of American involvement in the region.\n\nThere is another arc: the U.S. intervention in the war between Iran and Iraq in the 1980s, the intervention in Iraq itself, and then the continuing engagement around the Gulf that today is the dominant frame for how the American public perceives U.S. engagement in the Middle East, and how many of the players see it as well. And it explains why Egypt became less relevant. Is it a story about American influence, or is it really a story about the shift of our focus and the trouble zones in the region from the peace process to the Gulf?",

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov announced on July 11 that 11 partner states signed a memorandum on the terms for the coalition to train Ukrainian pilots on the F-16. Reznikov noted that the training program may include other fighter aircraft types and expressed his thanks to Denmark and the Netherlands for their ”outstanding leadership” in the process...The Kremlin’s and Russian milbloggers’ reactions to the first day of the NATO Summit were relatively muted. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov took a predictably dim view of the NATO Summit’s first day, complaining that the summit has a ”pronounced, concentrated anti-Russian character.” Peskov reiterated boilerplate rhetoric about how the West’s continued security assistance to Ukraine and Ukraine’s promised future membership in NATO would result in grave consequences. Russian milbloggers expressed general discontent about new weapons deliveries to Ukraine but have not voiced any major reactions at the time of this publication. The milbloggers are likely waiting to react to the main events that will occur on the summit’s second day when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with US President Joe Biden and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on July 12.",

Russian media reported that an unknown person shot Rzhitsky several times in Krasnodar and then fled the scene. The Investigative Committee of Russia posted footage of Russian authorities detaining a man in Kurban, Krasnodar Krai on July 11 on suspicion of murdering Rzhitsky. A Russian citizen previously attempted to kill a Russian officer at a recruitment office in Irkutsk shortly following the start of partial mobilization in Russia in late September 2022. Rzkitsky’s killing could be associated with continued discontent with mobilization, but ISW cannot definitively identify the motivation behind his killing at this time. Russian milbloggers claimed without offering evidence that Ukrainian operatives conducted the killing and compared it to previous high-profile killings of Russian ultranationalist figures in Russia...Key Takeaways:..Russian forces conducted a series of Shahed 131 and 136 drone strikes across Ukraine on July 11, likely in a demonstrative response to the 2023 NATO Summit in Vilnius and to threaten the Black Sea grain deal...Germany and France pledged to provide Ukraine more weapons systems during the first day of the 2023 NATO Summit in Vilnius on July 11...A coalition of 11 states signed a memorandum with Ukraine outlining the terms for training Ukrainian pilots on the F-16 aircraft at the 2023 NATO Summit in Vilnius on July 11...The Kremlin’s and Russian milbloggers’ reactions to the first day of the NATO Summit were relatively muted...Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu attempted to portray the Ukrainian counteroffensive as a failed effort against the backdrop of the NATO Summit...Ukrainian forces conducted counteroffensive operations on at least three sectors of the front on July 11 and made gains in some areas...A Ukrainian Storm Shadow missile strike reportedly killed Deputy Commander of the Russian Southern Military District (SMD) Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov at the command post of the 58th Combined Arms Army (CAA) in occupied Berdyansk, Zaporizhia Oblast...Russian milbloggers criticized the Russian military command for failing to defend against Ukrainian strikes on Russian headquarters.",

ISW will cover subsequent reports in the July 12 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment...Russian forces conducted a series of Shahed 131 and 136 drone strikes across Ukraine on July 11, likely in a demonstrative response to the 2023 NATO Summit in Vilnius and to threaten the Black Sea grain deal. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces shot down 26 of the 28 Russian Shahed 131 and 136 drones launched from the Primorsk-Akhtarsk (Krasnodar Krai) direction. The Ukrainian Southern Operational Command reported that Russian forces tried to strike the grain terminal in Odesa Oblast, and that two drones struck an administrative building at a port facility. Ukrainian Southern Operational Command Spokesperson Captain First Rank Nataliya Humenyuk stated that Russian forces targeted port infrastructure to disrupt the Black Sea Grain deal. Russia’s drone strikes on port infrastructure also coincide with the first day of the NATO summit in Vilnius and are likely intended to discourage NATO members from providing more military aid to Ukraine. Russia may be threatening the Black Sea grain deal to message the deal's original broker, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, that his recent statement of support for Ukraine’s NATO membership and the return of the five Ukrainian Azovstal commanders on July 7 has not gone unnoticed and is not appreciated by the Kremlin.",

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report...The leaders of Germany, France, Italy, and Romania committed to Ukrainian officials that the West would not demand any concessions from Ukraine to appease Russia and will support Ukraine to the end of the war during a visit to Kyiv on June 16. French President Emmanuel Macron declared that France, Germany, Italy, and Romania are “are doing everything so that Ukraine alone can decide its fate.” Macron added that Ukraine “must be able to win” and pledged to provide six more self-propelled howitzers. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that Germany will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, and weapons assistance for “Ukraine’s war of independence.” Macron, Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis additionally vowed to back Ukraine’s bid to become an official candidate for European Union membership. Sustained Western military support to Ukraine will be essential to enable Ukrainian forces to liberate Russian-occupied territory...Ukrainian defense officials explicitly requested Western heavy artillery, unmanned aerial vehicles, and multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) ahead of a protracted war. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Denys Sharapov and Land Force Command Logistics Commander Volodymyr Karpenko stated that Ukrainian forces need hundreds of artillery systems, including infantry fighting vehicles and tanks, as Ukrainian forces have suffered 30% to 50% equipment losses in active combat. Sharapov and Karpenko noted that Ukrainian forces need Predator drones and loitering munitions to accurately strike Russian forces. Sharapov and Karpenko also asked for long-range precision weapons such as MLRS to defend the entire 2,500 km frontline in Ukraine.",

Kagan and Mason Clark..February 18, 2022, 2:00 pm ET..Russia may launch an attack on Ukraine on Saturday, February 19, 2022. The attack would likely begin with an air and missile campaign targeting much of Ukraine to decapitate the government and degrade the Ukrainian military as well as the ability of Ukrainian citizens to prepare to resist a subsequent Russian invasion. US and allied governments have been warning of such an attack for some days, pointing to the size of the Russian forces concentrated on Ukraine’s borders. Western officials have additionally said that Russian troops have moved to jumping-off positions for an invasion over the past 24 hours. The following additional conditions and indicators point to February 19 as an optimal date for a Russian attack:..1. Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelensky will be in Germany at the Munich Security Conference. He is scheduled to speak at 1530 Munich time...His absence from Ukraine will degrade his ability to coordinate a response to any Russian attack and create more propitious circumstances for a Russian-sponsored attempt at a coup d’etat...Russian forces could close Ukrainian airspace to prevent Zelensky from returning to Kyiv...2. Russian President Vladimir Putin will reportedly oversee Russian nuclear drills on Saturday, February 19, as well.Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will accompany Putin...Those drills are being conducted out of the usual exercise cycle and are clearly intended to deter any Western response to an attack...Putin and Lukashenko will observe the exercises from an unspecified “situational center” in Moscow, likely the Russian Ministry of Defense’s National Defense Control Center (NDCC). That would put them in the best position to oversee conventional military operations as well...Launching the attack during those drills would take maximal advantage of their deterrent effect...3. Russian proxy provocations in eastern Ukraine have increased dramatically since February 16, including an artillery barrage that damaged a kindergarten in unoccupied Ukraine and multiple other proxy attacks.",

Elements of Russia’s 810th Naval Infantry Brigade—which Russia has previously held in reserve, possibly to conduct an amphibious landing—deployed to Mariupol on March 16.

Kagan and Mason Clark..with George Barros and Kateryna Stepanenko..Russia recognized the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR) and signed treaties of “friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance” with them on February 21, 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his decision in a lengthy speech on the same day. The text of these agreements has not been publicized as of this writing. The Russian Duma will likely vote to authorize the use of Russian military force to occupy the republics, and Russian conventional forces will likely move to do so within the next 24-36 hours. Russian formal recognition of the republics will likely include recognizing all their territorial claims, which extend to the portions of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts still under Ukrainian control...Putin issued a further ultimatum to Ukraine to cease all fighting against the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics. Ukraine has not been fighting and has refrained from responding to increasing Russian and separatist aggression, but Russia has repeatedly falsely attributed its proxies’ attacks to Ukraine and blamed Ukraine for false flag operations the proxies have conducted against themselves. Putin has therefore created an open-ended justification for future military action against Ukraine. The Kremlin can use the justification of any claimed Ukrainian attack on the newly recognized DNR/LNR to support a range of further military operations up to a full invasion of unoccupied Ukraine in the coming days. He might also claim that Ukrainian resistance to Russian moves to seize the unoccupied portions of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts justifies further Russian military action...Russian armed forces will likely attack Ukrainian forces at the line of contact to secure the portions of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts not currently under DNR/LNR control. An extensive Russian air/missile campaign throughout Ukraine will likely accompany that attack, ostensibly to facilitate it. These attacks may begin on February 22 or may follow in succeeding days.",

Russian efforts to deploy forces from Armenia, its proxy states in Georgia, and reserve units in the Eastern Military District will not provide Russian forces around Kyiv with the combat power necessary to complete the encirclement of the city in the near term. Russian forces made limited, unsuccessful attacks northwest of Kyiv and did not conduct offensive operations in northeastern Ukraine, toward Kharkiv, or toward Mykolayiv. Russian forces did make limited territorial gains in Donetsk Oblast and around Mariupol and continued to target civilian infrastructure in the city. Russian forces will likely continue to reduce the Mariupol pocket in the coming days, but Russian forces likely remain unable to conduct simultaneous attacks along multiple axes of advance...Key Takeaways..Russia is deploying reserves from Armenia and South Ossetia and cohering new battalion tactical groups (BTGs) from the remnants of units lost early in the invasion. These reinforcements will likely face equal or greater command and logistics difficulties to current frontline Russian units...President Zelensky created a new joint military-civilian headquarters responsible for the defense of Kyiv on March 15...Russian forces conducted several failed attacks northwest of Kyiv and no offensive operations northeast of Kyiv on March 16...Russian forces continue to shell civilian areas of Kharkiv, but will be unlikely to force the city to surrender without encircling it—which Russian forces appear unable to achieve...Russian forces continued to reduce the Mariupol pocket on March 16. Russian forces continue to commit war crimes in the city, targeting refugees and civilian infrastructure...Ukrainian Forces claimed to have killed the commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army’s 150th Motor Rifle Division near Mariupol on March 15.

The Ukrainian General Staff reported on December 7 that soldiers of the Belarusian border service and the Belarusian Armed forces are growing increasingly dissatisfied with the activities of the Belarusian military-political leadership due to the threat of Belarus entering the war in Ukraine. ISW has previously assessed that Russian Defense Minister Army General Shoigu met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and Belarusian Defense Minister Major General Viktor Khrenin on December 3 to place further pressure on Belarus to support Russia‘s offensive campaign in Ukraine. ISW has also previously reported that Belarusian officials, including Lukashenko and Khrenin, have used rhetoric to support an ongoing Russian information operation aimed at fixing Ukrainian forces on the Belarusian-Ukrainian border with the threat of Belarus entering the war. Russian pressure and the participation of Belarusian officials in the ongoing Russian information operation may be causing unease among Belarusian military personnel.

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces conducted strikes using 16 Kalibr sea-based cruise missiles, eight Kh-22 anti-ship missiles, six Onyx cruise missiles, one Kh-59 guided air missile, and 32 Iranian-made Shahed drones. Ukrainian military officials reported that Russian forces predominantly targeted civilian and military infrastructure in Odesa Oblast with Kh-22 and Onyx missiles and that Ukrainian forces shot down 37 air targets including 13 Kalibrs, one Kh-59 missile, and 23 Shaheds.

Ukrainian Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food Mykola Solskyi reported that Russian strikes destroyed 60,000 tons of grain in the Chornomorsk port in Odesa Oblast on the night of July 19. The Southern Operational Command added that Russian strikes also targeted coastal areas in Mykolaiv Oblast and some infrastructure in Kherson City. Spokesperson of the Ukrainian Southern Operational Command Captain of the First Rank Nataliya Humenyuk stated that the Russian July 19 strikes “happened virtually simultaneously,” and that Russian forces likely attempted to overwhelm the Ukrainian air defense systems. Ukrainian Air Forces Spokesperson Colonel Yuriy Ihnat stated that this attack was the most intense missile and drone attack on Odesa Oblast since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.",

  "page_content": "Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu attempted to portray the Ukrainian counteroffensive as a failed effort against the backdrop of the NATO Summit. Shoigu implausibly claimed on July 11 that Ukrainian forces have lost 26,000 servicemembers and 1,244 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles since starting counteroffensive operations on June 4. Shoigu also tried to present possible Ukrainian interdiction efforts in southern Ukraine as similarly ineffective by claiming that Russian air defenses have intercepted 176 HIMARS rockets and 27 Storm Shadow cruise missiles since the start of the counteroffensive. ISW assesses that Russian MoD reporting on Ukrainian losses is likely highly inflated, and even Russian milbloggers have recently accused the MoD of counting strikes on already damaged and destroyed vehicles as new Ukrainian equipment losses. Shoigu’s rhetoric about the Ukrainian counteroffensive notably contradicts the Kremlin’s reported media guidance instructing Russian state media not to downplay the counteroffensive or overstate Russian successes. Shoigu may be increasingly ignoring established Kremlin guidance on covering the counteroffensive in a renewed effort to portray the MoD as an effective manager of the war in Ukraine following the Wagner Group’s rebellion...Ukrainian forces conducted counteroffensive operations on at least three sectors of the front on July 11 and made gains in some areas. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations in the Melitopol (western Zaporizhia Oblast) and Berdyansk directions (Zaporizhia Oblast-Donetsk Oblast border area), and Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces Spokesperson Colonel Serhiy Cherevaty stated that Ukrainian forces are continuing counteroffensive operations around Bakhmut. Geolocated footage published on July 10 indicates that Ukrainian forces advanced northeast of Robotyne (15km south of Orikhiv). A Russian milblogger also claimed that Ukrainian forces established control over new positions northwest of Klishchiivka (7km southwest of Bakhmut) and advanced up to 1.5km near Rozdolivka (19km northeast of Bakhmut).",

  "page_content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to threaten increased attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure if reported Ukrainian attacks on Russian military positions in Russian Federation territory continue. Putin said that Russia has been “rather restrained in our response” to Ukrainian “terrorist acts [and] attempts to damage our civilian [sic] infrastructure” in a question-and-answer session with reporters following the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting on September 16. He continued “more recently, the Russian armed forces have dealt a couple of sensitive blows” that are “warning shots,” and threatened that more serious attacks could follow. Putin did not explicitly refer to the reported Ukrainian strikes on the base of the Russian 3rd Motorized Rifle Division near Valuyki that occurred on September 16, nor did he make clear which Russian actions he was referring to. But Russian forces have increased attacks on civilian infrastructure throughout Ukraine over the past several weeks as Russian media personalities increase explicit calls for such attacks...Putin’s comments are likely in part a response to criticism by Russian milbloggers, who attacked the Kremlin for failing to protect Russian territory and for failing to respond adequately. One milblogger asked if the Kremlin still regards Belgorod Oblast as part of Russia, part of the “special military operation” zone, or part of Ukraine. Another blamed the reported Ukrainian attack on Valuyki on the so-called “regrouping” of Russian forces (referring to the initial language the Russian Ministry of Defense used to describe the rout of Russian forces in Kharkiv Oblast) and warned that another “regrouping” could allow Ukrainian forces to attack other critical Russian areas. Putin has increasingly shown a determination to appease the milbloggers and the constituencies they speak to and on behalf of, even at the expense of the uniformed Russian military and the Russian Ministry of Defense...The Ukrainian Resistance Center warned on September 16 that Russian forces are planning to conduct false flag attacks against civilian population in Russian-occupied Ukraine and urged Ukrainians in occupied areas to avoid public places between September 17 and September 20. The Resistance Center suggested that such false flag attacks could be attempts to “divert the attention of the world community from the defeat in Kharkiv and the discovery of Russian war crimes” in liberated areas...Key Takeaways",

The Russian military is continuing to set conditions for the full-scale attack but has reportedly not yet completed its preparations. The New York Times reported on February 20 that US intelligence confirmed the Russian military has prepared to execute an attack plan, and 40-50 percent of units have shifted into \"combat formations.” CNN separately reported the United States still has not seen several “larger actions,” such as electronic jamming and cyberattacks, beyond the currently observed tactical indicators to indicate preparations for larger-scale kinetic activity...Putin’s speech of February 21, 2022, laid out an extensive list of grievances against the current Ukrainian government, NATO, and the United States. It rejected the legitimacy of any independent Ukrainian state and implicitly questioned the legitimacy of any of the post-Soviet states. Putin reiterated his false claims that NATO was planning to deploy offensive weapons into Ukraine that would threaten Russia as well as his complaints that NATO had not acceded to his formal demands regarding NATO expansion, the disposition of NATO military infrastructure, and the deployment of specific weapons systems near Russian territory. This speech could serve as the basis for a justification for an invasion and occupation of all of Ukraine, but Putin has not yet gone that far...The initiation of a Russian attack in eastern Ukraine would offer Putin many opportunities to expand his narratives to support a full-scale invasion. In the absence of the emergence of a clear narrative justifying the invasion-to-conquer course of action, therefore, we forecast that hostilities will begin in the east and with air and missile attacks throughout Ukraine’s depth, likely with some pause before Putin launches further invasions of unoccupied Ukraine...Click here to expand the map below.",

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius stated that Germany will provide Ukraine with two Patriot air defense launchers, 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, 25 Leopard 1A5 main battle tanks, and five Bergepanzer 2 armored recovery vehicles over an unspecified time period. France will reportedly send Ukraine Storm Shadow missiles. French President Emmanuel Macron stated that he decided to send Ukraine weapons to allow Ukrainian forces to conduct deep strikes.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov announced on July 11 that 11 partner states signed a memorandum on the terms for the coalition to train Ukrainian pilots on the F-16. Reznikov noted that the training program may include other fighter aircraft types and expressed his thanks to Denmark and the Netherlands for their ”outstanding leadership” in the process...The Kremlin’s and Russian milbloggers’ reactions to the first day of the NATO Summit were relatively muted. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov took a predictably dim view of the NATO Summit’s first day, complaining that the summit has a ”pronounced, concentrated anti-Russian character.” Peskov reiterated boilerplate rhetoric about how the West’s continued security assistance to Ukraine and Ukraine’s promised future membership in NATO would result in grave consequences. Russian milbloggers expressed general discontent about new weapons deliveries to Ukraine but have not voiced any major reactions at the time of this publication. The milbloggers are likely waiting to react to the main events that will occur on the summit’s second day when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with US President Joe Biden and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on July 12.",

Sharapov and Karpenko noted that Ukrainian forces need Predator drones and loitering munitions to accurately strike Russian forces. Sharapov and Karpenko also asked for long-range precision weapons such as MLRS to defend the entire 2,500 km frontline in Ukraine.",

  "page_content": "The Kremlin continues measures to gradually mobilize Russia’s defense industrial base (DIB) to meet Russian military demands in Ukraine without conducting a wider economic mobilization. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu stated on July 11 that the amount of weapons and equipment supplied to the Russian military under the Russian state defense order has almost doubled since March 2022. Shoigu claimed that the MoD increased deliveries of Orlan-10/30 reconnaissance drones by a factor of 53, deliveries of T-72 and T-90 tanks by a factor of 3.6, deliveries of Mi-28 helicopters by a factor of three, and deliveries of Ka-52 helicopters by a factor of two. Shoigu did not specify what percentage of these increased deliveries came from existing stocks or from new production. Shoigu claimed that Russian enterprises have increased the production of ammunition by a factor of 10 since the start of 2022. Shoigu also visited DIB facilities in the Republic of Tatarstan on July 11, including the Kamskiy Avtomobilnyy Zavod (KAMAZ) plant and a KAMAZ subsidiary Remdiesel facility in Naberezhnye Chelny. Shoigu claimed that KAMAZ is ahead of schedule on fulfilling the state defense order and suggested that the Russian Ministry of Defense’s (MoD) Main Armored Vehicle Department form a working group with KAMAZ to maintain vehicles on the frontline in Ukraine. Shoigu visited the Kazan Helicopter Plant in Kazan, Republic of Tartarstan, and heard reports about the production of ”Ansat” light helicopters and modifications to Mi-8 helicopters. Shoigu also inspected the Gorbunov Kazan Aviation Plant and claimed that the plant will produce two modernized Tu-150 strategic missile carriers by the end of 2023 in accordance with the state defense order. A Russian milblogger also claimed on July 11 that the Kurganmashzavod joint stock company in Kurgan Oblast recently shipped another batch of BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles to Russian forces as part of the state defense order. These claims of Russian DIB activity do not suggest an increase in efforts to mobilize the DIB, and Russia appears to be prioritizing the production of certain armaments and equipment due to DIB constraints. ISW assesses that the Kremlin is unlikely to start a wider economic mobilization due to fears that such a mobilization would create further domestic economic disruptions and corresponding discontent within Russia.",

The Russian usage of Kh-101 missiles to strike a Ukrainian military factory could indicate that Russian forces are either running out of appropriate munitions for such strikes or are desperate to curtail Ukrainian strikes on Russian military infrastructure by targeting Ukrainian supplies of missile and rocket systems...The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces continued shelling the line of contact and did not conduct ground offensives on July 16...Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)..Nothing significant to report...Activity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied areas; set conditions for potential annexation into the Russian Federation or some other future political arrangement of Moscow’s choosing)",

The Misagh-1 has an engagement range of 50-5,000 m, whereas the Misagh-2 has an engagement range of 500-6,000 m. Both variants use a 1.42 kg warhead. The Misagh is a clone of the Chinese QW-1 Vanguard missile system. (UAS Vision, TRADOC)..The Sadid-345 is a guided glide bomb. Its exact specifications are unclear. The Sadid-1 is an earlier variant of this munition that reportedly experienced R&D setbacks due to US sanctions. (*Khabar Online, Medium)..The Shafagh is a laser-guided missile that is often used for anti-armor missions. It can hit fixed and moving ground and naval targets within 8-12 km. Newer variants of the missile have an expanded operational range of 15-20 km. The missile has a 13 kg warhead. (Iran Press, *Mashregh News,)..The Simorgh is a cluster bomb that weighs around 250 kg. Iranian media has compared the Simorgh to the British BL755. (*Mashregh News)..The Yasin is a long-range guided glide bomb. The munition has an engagement range of 60-100 km. It uses a MK-82 225 kg bomb as a warhead. (Iran Press)..The Shahed-129 uses a ground control station and datalink to operate, which may limit the platform’s operational range. (Source: TRADOC)",

  "page_content": "The Russian Defense Ministry is likely trying to assuage distress that Ukraine’s effective use of the US HIMARS is causing Russian military personnel and milbloggers with inaccurate claims of destroying HIMARS launchers. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu claimed that Russian forces have destroyed six US-provided HIMARS and other Western-supplied military equipment in Ukraine in a conference call with the Russian Armed Forces leadership on August 2. The Russian Defense Ministry also released a video claiming to have destroyed a building that housed two HIMARS launchers in Kharkiv Oblast on August 1. Ukrainian Southern Command Chief Andriy Kovalchuk said that Russian forces did not destroy any HIMARS, and an unnamed Finnish official called Russian claims ”wishful thinking.” The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) also reported that Russian defense authorities are covering up Russian servicemember casualties by transporting wounded Russians in civilian cars and misreporting the number of casualties caused by Ukrainian HIMARS strikes in the media. Ukrainian HIMARS strikes have prompted many milbloggers and military correspondents to express concern over the effectiveness of air defense systems and the threats to Russian logistics, and these strikes are likely demoralizing Russian servicemen on the ground.",

  "page_content": "Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu attempted to portray the Ukrainian counteroffensive as a failed effort against the backdrop of the NATO Summit. Shoigu implausibly claimed on July 11 that Ukrainian forces have lost 26,000 servicemembers and 1,244 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles since starting counteroffensive operations on June 4. Shoigu also tried to present possible Ukrainian interdiction efforts in southern Ukraine as similarly ineffective by claiming that Russian air defenses have intercepted 176 HIMARS rockets and 27 Storm Shadow cruise missiles since the start of the counteroffensive. ISW assesses that Russian MoD reporting on Ukrainian losses is likely highly inflated, and even Russian milbloggers have recently accused the MoD of counting strikes on already damaged and destroyed vehicles as new Ukrainian equipment losses. Shoigu’s rhetoric about the Ukrainian counteroffensive notably contradicts the Kremlin’s reported media guidance instructing Russian state media not to downplay the counteroffensive or overstate Russian successes. Shoigu may be increasingly ignoring established Kremlin guidance on covering the counteroffensive in a renewed effort to portray the MoD as an effective manager of the war in Ukraine following the Wagner Group’s rebellion...Ukrainian forces conducted counteroffensive operations on at least three sectors of the front on July 11 and made gains in some areas. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations in the Melitopol (western Zaporizhia Oblast) and Berdyansk directions (Zaporizhia Oblast-Donetsk Oblast border area), and Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces Spokesperson Colonel Serhiy Cherevaty stated that Ukrainian forces are continuing counteroffensive operations around Bakhmut. Geolocated footage published on July 10 indicates that Ukrainian forces advanced northeast of Robotyne (15km south of Orikhiv). A Russian milblogger also claimed that Ukrainian forces established control over new positions northwest of Klishchiivka (7km southwest of Bakhmut) and advanced up to 1.5km near Rozdolivka (19km northeast of Bakhmut).",

Spokesperson of the Ukrainian Southern Operational Command Captain of the First Rank Nataliya Humenyuk stated that the Russian July 19 strikes “happened virtually simultaneously,” and that Russian forces likely attempted to overwhelm the Ukrainian air defense systems.

Ukrainian Air Force Command Spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat stated on December 7 that Russian forces resumed the use of Iranian-made loitering munitions after a three-week break and suggested that Russian forces had faced complications using the drones due to icing issues in colder weather. Ukrainian Southern Command Spokesperson Natalia Humenyuk stated on December 7 that Russian forces resumed the use of the Iranian-made drones intending to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses in various areas of activity and open areas of the front in Ukraine. Russian and Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces deployed Shahed-136 drones in attacks on Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Zhytomyr, and Zaporizhia Oblasts. Russian forces have likely modified the drones to operate in colder weather conditions and will likely increase their use in Ukraine in the coming weeks in support of their campaign against Ukrainian critical infrastructure.

Russian sources claimed on July 10 that Rogozin met with Progress Rocket Space Center Regional Director Dmitry Baranov to discuss the possibility of launching Soviet FAB-500 aerial bombs with ballistic systems produced by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology. Rogozin was reportedly interested in retrofitting the FAB-500 bombs to survive reentry into the atmosphere, and Baranov reportedly stated that the modification process would take six to nine months. A Moscow affiliate of the Russian source claimed that a source close to Rogozin confirmed the meeting between Baranov and Rogozin and added that the two also discussed the possibility of adapting high-power volumetric detonating bombs (ODAMs) for use in ballistic strikes. The source reportedly stated that dense Ukrainian air defenses prevent Russian forces from using the ODAMs extensively and that ballistic delivery systems may allow Russian forces to fire the ODAMs at a distance of 700 to 1200km. Rogozin may be using former connections with the Russian aerospace field to amplify these proposals and promote himself and the ”Tsarkiye Volky“ volunteer battalion he is affiliated with, although it is unclear if Russian officials are seriously considering these proposals. These proposals regardless of their seriousness are reflective of Russian concerns about their lack of long-range strike capabilities in Ukraine...The United Kingdom Ministry of Defense (UK MoD) reported on July 11 that Moscow municipal authorities are threatening to withdraw contracts with construction firms if the firms fail to achieve the MoD’s volunteer recruitment quotas...Activities in Russian-occupied areas (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)",

The United Kingdom Ministry of Defense (MoD) reported on November 26 that Russia is likely removing nuclear warheads from aging Kh-55 missiles and launching the missiles without warheads at targets in Ukraine. The UK MoD suggested that Russian forces are likely launching the inert missiles as decoys to divert Ukrainian air defenses. Ukrainian officials have previously reported that since mid-October, Russian forces have extensively used the non-nuclear variant of the missile system, the Kh-555, to conduct strikes on critical Ukrainian infrastructure. The Russian military’s likely use of a more strategic weapon system in the role of a decoy for Ukrainian air defenses corroborates ISW’s previous reporting that the Russian military has significantly depleted its arsenal of high-precision missiles. The use of more strategic weapons systems in support of the campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure suggests that the Russian military is heavily committed to the strike campaign and still mistakenly believes that it can generate strategically significant effects through that campaign...Key Takeaways..The overall pace of operations in Ukraine is likely to increase in the upcoming weeks as the ground freezes throughout the theater...Russian officials are continuing efforts to deport Ukrainian children to Russia...Russian officials may be trying to counteract Wagner financier Yevgeny Prigozhin’s growing influence through the promotion of other parallel Russian military structures...Russian forces are likely using inert Kh-55 missiles designed solely to carry nuclear warheads in its campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure, highlighting the Russian military’s depletion of high-precision weapons...Russian forces continued defensive operations against ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line...Russian forces continued offensive operations in the directions of Bakhmut and Avdiivka...Russian forces continued establishing fortifications in eastern Kherson Oblast...Russian tactical, logistical, and equipment failures continue to decrease the morale of Russian troops and drive searches for scapegoats.",

Russian forces also shelled other settlements in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk Oblasts with MLRS and tube artillery. Russian forces did not fire on Nikopol on August 2, however they are likely to resume attacks on the settlement. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken also noted that Russian forces are continuing to use the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) just south of Nikopol, as a “human shield” for their military base, as Ukrainian forces will not fire at the NPP in self-defense...Ukrainian forces continued to target Russian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) and positions in Kherson Oblast, setting conditions for a counteroffensive in the region. Geolocated footage showed that Ukrainian forces struck Russian ammunition depots in Arkhanhel’s’ke and Starosillya, both situated on the T2207 GLOC in northwestern Kherson Oblast and the eastern Inhulets River bank. Geolocated footage showed Ukrainian forces hitting Russian mortar positions in Soldatske (approximately 30km northwest of Kherson City) with a likely US-provided Phoenix Ghost loitering munition. The Ukrainian Southern Operational Command reported that Ukrainian aviation also hit three Russian strongholds in Oleksandrivka and Maksymivka, indicating that Ukrainian aviation continues to operate northwest and north of Kherson City.

  "page_content": "A representative of the Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported on August 2 that Russia has refused to provide detailed information on which Ukrainian POWs were killed or injured in the July 28 Olenivka prison attack. GUR Representative Andriy Yusov said that Russia has not responded to requests by Ukraine’s Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs for information about casualties from the likely Russian-perpetrated attack on the Russian-controlled prison that killed at least 53 Ukrainian POWs. Yusov said that of casualties that Russia has posted online some were supposed to be in hospitals or being readied for prisoner exchanges and were not supposed to be at the Olenivka prison. Yusov noted that Ukraine cannot confirm the veracity of online casualty lists at this time, however. Ukraine’s Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs urged families of POWs to avoid sharing personal details about themselves or their captured loved ones with individuals or unofficial organizations soliciting those details, warning that sharing information could pose a risk to surviving POWs. Deputy Ukrainian Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said that Russia has not responded to requests to return the bodies of killed POWs to Ukraine as of August 2...Initial and unconfirmed reports from August 2 suggest that Iran may have sent the first batch of UAVs to Russia for field testing. A US-based open-source intelligence (OSINT) Twitter account citing unofficial Iranian sources claimed that Iran sent a batch of UAVs to Russia, along with Iranian pilots and technicians who will train for the use and repair of Russian Su-35 aircraft. While ISW cannot independently confirm this claim, it is consistent with recent reports that Tehran and Moscow are pursuing greater aviation cooperation in order to circumvent international sanctions on Russia and Iran and support Russian operations in Ukraine. If true, this claim suggests that Iran may be receiving Russian Su-35 aircraft in return for the drones, which could have been part of an agreement signed by Moscow and Tehran on July 26. The agreement stipulated that Iran would increase the volume of passenger flights to Russia and additionally repair Russian aircraft. Tehran may seek to use this agreement to facilitate the acquisition of Russian combat aircraft.",

Kagan and Mason Clark..February 18, 2022, 2:00 pm ET..Russia may launch an attack on Ukraine on Saturday, February 19, 2022. The attack would likely begin with an air and missile campaign targeting much of Ukraine to decapitate the government and degrade the Ukrainian military as well as the ability of Ukrainian citizens to prepare to resist a subsequent Russian invasion. US and allied governments have been warning of such an attack for some days, pointing to the size of the Russian forces concentrated on Ukraine’s borders. Western officials have additionally said that Russian troops have moved to jumping-off positions for an invasion over the past 24 hours. The following additional conditions and indicators point to February 19 as an optimal date for a Russian attack:..1. Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelensky will be in Germany at the Munich Security Conference. He is scheduled to speak at 1530 Munich time...His absence from Ukraine will degrade his ability to coordinate a response to any Russian attack and create more propitious circumstances for a Russian-sponsored attempt at a coup d’etat...Russian forces could close Ukrainian airspace to prevent Zelensky from returning to Kyiv...2. Russian President Vladimir Putin will reportedly oversee Russian nuclear drills on Saturday, February 19, as well.Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will accompany Putin...Those drills are being conducted out of the usual exercise cycle and are clearly intended to deter any Western response to an attack...Putin and Lukashenko will observe the exercises from an unspecified “situational center” in Moscow, likely the Russian Ministry of Defense’s National Defense Control Center (NDCC). That would put them in the best position to oversee conventional military operations as well...Launching the attack during those drills would take maximal advantage of their deterrent effect...3. Russian proxy provocations in eastern Ukraine have increased dramatically since February 16, including an artillery barrage that damaged a kindergarten in unoccupied Ukraine and multiple other proxy attacks.",

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Russian forces launched airstrikes on Ukrainian positions in Bilohirka and Bila Krynytsia, seemingly confirming that Ukraine retains a bridgehead on the eastern Inhulets River bank. Satellite imagery also showed that Russian forces dug trenches near the Antonivskyi Bridge (on the right bank of the Dnipro River) and set up radar reflectors along both Antonivskyi road and railway bridges to prevent Ukrainian missile strikes.

The use of such an expensive, rare, and high-end system to hit an ammunition depot was likely signaling and demonstrating intent and capability to escalate rather than seeking to achieve a concrete military objective. The Kinzhal is a dual-use missile that can carry a nuclear payload, although the one used in Ukraine bore a conventional high-explosive payload. Its use likely signaled Moscow’s willingness to consider using low-yield nuclear weapons in addition to demonstrating the capability to use hypersonic weapons.",

Kherson City Council member Gayane Oganesyan claimed on October 22 that Russian and occupation administration officials are relocating detainees and prisoners from detention centers in Kherson Oblast to undisclosed locations under the guise of ongoing evacuation efforts in Kherson Oblast. Russian officials continued to lay the administrative framework for the forcible relocation of residents from Kherson Oblast. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin signed a resolution on October 22 that defined the rules under which Kherson residents that permanently resettle in other Russian territories may receive housing subsidy payments totaling 100,000 rubles (about $1,622). A Russian source reported that residents who fled or were forcibly relocated from Kherson Oblast have begun to receive housing certificates in Krasnodar Krai. The head of Russian-occupied Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, stated that his administration would extend housing certificates and subsidies to all Russian citizens relocating from Kherson City and settlements west of the Dnipro River. Russian and occupation administration officials will likely continue to accelerate efforts to forcibly relocate residents in Kherson Oblast in the coming days as Ukraine’s southern counteroffensive progresses...Russian and occupation administration officials continued to restrict the movement of residents living in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on October 21 that Russian forces are increasing the number of checkpoints and strengthening controls at existing ones throughout the Russian-occupied territories. The Resistance Center also reported on October 22 that the temporary travel permit regime introduced by occupation administrations on October 1 has reduced the number of residents travelling to Ukrainian-held territory by a factor of ten in the last month. The Resistance Center reported that Russian forces also collect the fingerprints, addresses, and destinations of all men under 35 years of age who pass through the Vasylivka checkpoint in Zaporizhia Oblast, likely to prepare for the future forcible mobilization of those Ukrainian civilians. Russian and occupation administration officials are likely to increase restrictions on movement as Ukrainian counteroffensive operations progress.",

  "page_content": "Russian occupation authorities ordered the forcible “evacuation” of civilians from Kherson City on October 22. The Russian Kherson Occupation Administration announced that “all citizens of Kherson must immediately leave the city” and said that all civilians and “all departments and ministries of civil administration must now cross over to the [east] bank of the [Dnipro River].” The occupation administration cited the “tense” situation at the front, “increased danger of massive shelling of the city and the threat of terrorist attacks” and provided instructions for where evacuees can find boats to take them across the river. The occupation administration encouraged evacuees to bring clothes, valuables, and documents, indicating that they do not expect a rapid Russian or civilian return to western Kherson. Russian forces expect to leave the city and are therefore likely trying to depopulate parts of the oblast that Ukraine will recapture, damaging the long-term social and economic viability of southern Ukraine. Russian authorities are likely also making initial efforts to evacuate at least those civilians who are willing to cooperate with Russian occupation authorities and would otherwise be in the path of flooding resulting from the blown Kakhovka dam...Russian forces conducted massive missile and drone attacks to degrade Ukrainian energy infrastructure in nine oblasts on October 22. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on October 22 that Russian forces launched 40 missile strikes and 16 Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones at Ukrainian infrastructure and that Ukrainian forces shot down 20 Russian cruise missiles and 11 Russian drones. Russian strikes hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure in Volyn, Rivne, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Cherkasy, Zaporizhia, Odesa, and Mykolaiv oblasts. Ukrenergo, the Ukrainian state energy company, announced on October 22 that the scale of Russian strikes on October 22 met or exceeded the scale and effect of Russian strikes on October 10-12, which Russian President Vladimir Putin had falsely implied were a discrete response to Ukraine’s October 8 attack on the Kerch Strait Bridge. Instead, Russian forces are likely attempting to degrade Ukraine’s will to fight and to force the Ukrainian government to apply additional resources to protecting civilians and energy infrastructure in lieu of channeling those resources toward Ukraine’s counteroffensives in the east and south.",

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces have completely abandoned their positions in Charivne and Chkalove (both approximately 33km northwest of Nova Kakhovka), and Russian officers and medics have reportedly evacuated from Beryslav. The Ukrainian General Staff added that Russian forces are also removing patients from the Kakhovka Hospital on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, likely to free up hospital beds for Russian military casualties that may result from the withdrawal across the river. The Ukrainian General Staff noted that some Russian elements are preparing Kherson City for urban combat, while other servicemembers continue to flee the city via the ferry operating in the vicinity of the Antonivsky Bridge. The UK Ministry of Defense reported on October 22 that Russian forces completed construction of a barge bridge alongside the damaged bridge and forecasted that the barge bridge would become a critical crossing point for Russian forces as Ukrainian forces advance toward Kherson City.

The Russian-appointed deputy head of the Kherson Occupation Administration stated the strike occurred during a meeting of Russian-appointed city and municipal heads. Occupation authorities reported three deaths as of 1550 local time. Kherson Oblast deputy occupation head Kirill Stremousov and several Russian milbloggers reported that Ukraine used HIMARS to conduct the strike. Ukraine’s Kherson Oblast Military Administration Advisor Serhiy Khlan confirmed that Ukrainian forces struck Russian occupation authorities on September 16 and destroyed a Rosgvardia base in the city center on an unspecified date, warning civilians in occupied Kherson to stay away from Russian positions.

Skibitsky had previously reported that Russian forces started redeploying airborne troops from Donetsk Oblast to occupied Kherson Oblast territories, and the BTG will likely support Russian efforts to suppress Ukrainian counteroffensives in the region. Skibitsky added that Russian forces are expanding air defense systems in Crimea and are regrouping forces in the Zaporizhia and Kherson Oblast directions, which likely indicates that Russian forces are intending to defend their positions from Ukrainian counteroffensives throughout the Southern Axis. The Ukrainian Southern Operational Command noted that there have not been any changes to the Russian force composition in Kherson Oblast as of August 2, however.

Kuznetsova noted that the Headquarters is sending children affected by the war to Sochi, Krasnodar Krai, for “rehabilitation.” Luhansk Oblast Administration Head Serhiy Haidai reported that Russian occupation officials are transporting children from Luhansk Oblast to the Chechen Republic for patriotic education. Haidai stated that there are already more than 100 cases of deportation.

The Ukrainian advisor to the Mayor of Mariupol Petro Andryushchenko reported that Russian forces settled in Ahrobaza and Berdyanske near Mariupol, resulting in military patrols on the village streets. Andryushchenko further reported that occupation officials installed a mobile checkpoint for cars and male pedestrians in the “Morning Market” area of Mariupol for the first time since September.

The sources reported that the attack did not injure Volyk...Ukrainian authorities continue to enforce tough measures on occupation collaborators.

The Ukrainian Resistance Center also reported on August 2 that many schools in occupied areas will be unable to open by September 1, the ordinary start of the school year, because Ukrainian children and their families have either evacuated or are unwilling to attend Russian-run schools.

Leningrad Oblast offered recruits a one-time payment of 200,000 rubles (about $3,200) and other social benefits. St. Petersburg outlet ”Fontanka” contacted a St. Petersburg military recruitment center and discovered that St. Petersburg is forming an unnamed motorized rifle volunteer battalion and confirmed that Russian forces will pay recruits 100,000 rubles ($1,600) for one month of training and will pay 3,300 rubles (about $53) per day of combat service in Ukraine. The report also stated that enlisted servicemen may receive an additional 50,000-100,000 rubles (about $800-1,600) for destroying Ukrainian military equipment in battle.

Ukrainian news source Ria-Melitopol reported on July 16 that Russian authorities in Melitopol have substantially increased Russian military presence in the city and established checkpoints to stop and strip-search civilians. Kherson Oblast Administration similarly warned that Russian occupation authorities in the Kakhovskyi district (near Kherson City) have issued an order to strengthen the access regime for communal enterprises and other checkpoints, which will allow Russian forces to detain suspected Ukrainian “terrorists” for 72 hours for violating controls on the access regime. Ukraine’s Center for Strategic Cooperation noted that Russian authorities are struggling to galvanize public support for occupation administrations in Kharkiv Oblast and in the cities of Melitopol and Mariupol. These reports indicate that Russian authorities perceive a growing threat to the consolidation of occupational regimes and will likely continue efforts to crack down on pro-Ukrainian sentiments and actions in occupied areas.",

Kagan..July 23, 6:00 pm ET..Click here to see ISW's interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report...Ukrainian forces are likely preparing to launch or have launched a counteroffensive in Kherson Oblast as of July 23, but open-source visibility on the progress and tempo of the counteroffensive will likely be limited and lag behind events. Ukrainian Kherson Oblast Administration Adviser Serhiy Khlan stated on July 23 that Ukrainian forces have seized unspecified settlements in Kherson Oblast but called on Ukrainian civilians to remain silent on the progress of the counteroffensive until Ukrainian authorities release official statements. Foreign Policy National Security Reporter Jack Detsch reported on July 22 that an unspecified senior US defense official stated that Ukrainian forces have recaptured unspecified “portions of Russian-occupied villages” in Kherson over the past week of July 15-22, indicating that Ukrainian forces have made some unspecified territorial advances along frontlines. The area between the front line and Kherson City is rural and primarily composed of small settlements that are less likely to report on force movements and engagements, allowing control-of-terrain in this area to change without evidence appearing in open-source reporting. Russian authorities additionally have no incentive to report on Ukrainian territorial gains. The informational dynamics that allow ISW to report on Russian offensive operations with relatively little lag are thus inverted in this situation. ISW will report on the progress of any Ukrainian counteroffensives to the best of its ability within these constraints.",

Pushilin signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with Moscow Oblast Governor Andrey Vorobyov under which Moscow Oblast will offer patronage to Tel’manivskyi and Novoazovsk districts, just east of Mariupol. Pushilin signed another memorandum with Tula Governor Alexei Dyumin for the restoration of Mariupol’s Left Bank district. Pushillin also discussed patronage over occupied Khrestivka (northeast of Donetsk City) with the Republic of Sakha Head Aisen Nikolaev and unspecified Donetsk Oblast settlements with the Tver Oblast Governor Igor Rudenya. Pushilin is likely attempting to secure Russian financial assistance to restore occupied settlements in Donetsk Oblast, but his cooperation agreements with Russian local officials further indicate the DNR‘s lack of coherent annexation policies...The Kremlin is introducing more measures to establish permanent societal control over occupied Ukrainian territories. Self-proclaimed Deputy Head of the Kherson Military-Civil Administration Kiril Stremousov announced that all children born in Kherson Oblast after February 24 will automatically receive Russian citizenship. The Russian Internal Ministry also announced that Ukrainian “refugees” (many of whom were likely forcibly relocated to Russia) from occupied territories must receive proper documentation before August 17 to remain in Russia. The Kremlin likely seeks to coerce illegally deported Ukrainian citizens in Russia to accept Russian citizenship or return to Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine.",

Ukrainian officials confirmed that Ukrainian forces destroyed a field ammunition depot in Vysoke (about 48km due northeast of Kherson City), and geolocated footage showed another large explosion in northern Kherson Oblast near the Dnipro River. Advisor to the Ukrainian Internal Affairs Minister Anton Herashenko also confirmed that Ukrainian forces used western-provided HIMARS to strike a 40-car train with Russian equipment and personnel in Brylivka (about 47km southeast of Kherson City) on July 30, resulting in 80 dead and 200 wounded Russian servicemen. Ukrainian news outlet “Ria Melitopol” published footage of an explosion at the Melitopol airfield on July 31. Ukrainian forces had targeted a reported Russian ammunition depot and base near the airfield on July 3. Ukrainian forces likely conducted the strike against the airfield, but Ukrainian officials have not taken credit for or explained the explosion as of the time of this publication. The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) also confirmed that a Ukrainian strike on Russian positions in Verhniy Tokmak and Chernihivka (both approximately 40km southeast of Tokmak) on July 29, resulted in Russian forces relocating their personnel and equipment from those settlements to Berdyansk and Tokmak. The GUR specified that approximately 100 Russian servicemen remain around Chernihivka to maintain checkpoints but that most of the personnel are relocating and mining the roads. The GUR also noted that the strike wounded at least 40 Russian servicemen...Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)",
